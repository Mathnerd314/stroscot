Types are hard. Academics have spent decades in search of the perfect type system, often not even paying attention to the work of others.

Primitive types include bitstring patterns and pointers. Can't go wrong there.
```
i8 4
# binary 00000100
i8 129
# Error: cannot convert
```

vtables such as C++ and Jva seem like a mistake, so we'll skip inheritance.
