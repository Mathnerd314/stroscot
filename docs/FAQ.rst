Does it run?
~~~~~~~~~~~~

No, it's in the design stage.

What language is the compiler written in?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A near-term goal is to write Stroscot in itself. However, it has to generate code first. I picked JavaScript to start for a number of reasons:
* It's the fastest interpreted language available
* It has reasonably up-to-date syntax and features thanks to TC39
* A lot of the :ref:`inspiring projects <inspiring-projects>` were written in JS
* LLVM compiles to JS and there are LLVM bindings available for JS
* TypeScript doesn't add much besides compilation overhead


Where can I ask questions?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our `reddit community <https://www.reddit.com/r/stroscot>`__ (checked
monthly) or in the #stroscot channel on the `/r/ProgrammingLanguages
Discord server <https://discord.gg/4Kjt3ZE>`__.
