  abstract = {this paper was quite di\#erent, stemming from the axiomatics of categories of tangles (although the authors were aware of possible connections to iteration theories. In fact, similar axiomatics in the symmetric case, motivated by flowcharts and "flownomials" had been developed some years earlier by Stefanescu (Stefanescu 2000).) However, the first author realized, following a stimulating discussion with Gordon Plotkin, that traced monoidal categories provided a common denominator for the axiomatics of both the Girard-style and Abramsky-Jagadeesan-style versions of the Geometry of Interaction, at the basic level of the multiplicatives. This insight was presented in (Abramsky 1996), in which Girard-style GoI was dubbed "particle-style", since it concerns information particles or tokens flowing around a network, while the Abramsky-Jagadeesan style GoI was dubbed "wave-style", since it concerns the evolution of a global information state or "wave". Formally, this distinction is based on whether the tensor product (i.e. the symmetric monoidal structure) in the underlying category is interpreted as a coproduct (particle style) or as a product (wave style). This computational distinction between coproduct and product interpretations of the same underlying network geometry turned out to have been partially anticipated, in a rather di\#erent context, in a pioneering paper by E. S. Bainbridge (Bainbridge 1976), as observed by Dusko Pavlovic. These two forms of interpretation, and ways of combining them, have also been studied recently in (Stefanescu 2000). He uses the terminology "additive" for coproduct-based (i.e. our "particle-style") and "multiplicative" for product-based (i.e. our "wave-style"); this is not suitable for our purposes, because of the clash with Linear Logic term...},

  abstract = {When programs feature a complex control flow, existing techniques for resource analysis produce cost relation systems (CRS) whose cost functions retain the complex flow of the program and, consequently, might not be solvable into closed-form upper bounds. This paper presents a novel approach to resource analysis that is driven by the result of a termination analysis. The fundamental idea is that the termination proof encapsulates the flows of the program which are relevant for the cost computation so that, by driving the generation of the CRS using the termination proof, we produce a linearly-bounded CRS (LB-CRS). A LB-CRS is composed of cost functions that are guaranteed to be locally bounded by linear ranking functions and thus greatly simplify the process of CRS solving. We have built a new resource analysis tool, named MaxCore, that is guided by the VeryMax termination analyzer and uses CoFloCo and PUBS as CRS solvers. Our experimental results on the set of benchmarks from the Complexity and Termination Competition 2019 for C Integer programs show that MaxCore outperforms all other resource analysis tools. Under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.},

Actually, the revamping of this problem is just an excuse for writing an essay that aims at explaining sophisticated type-theoretic concepts, in simple terms and by examples, to undergraduate computer science students and/or willing functional programmers. Finally, I took advantage of this opportunity to describe some undocumented advanced techniques of type-systems implementation that are known only to few insiders that dug in the code of some compilers: therefore, even expert language designers and implementers may find this work worth of reading.},

  abstract = {Curried functions apparently take one argument at a time, which is slow. So optimizing compilers for higher-order languages invariably have some mechanism for working around currying by passing several arguments at once, as many as the function can handle, which is known as its arity. But such mechanisms are often ad-hoc, and do not work at all in higher-order functions. We show how extensional, call-by-name functions have the correct behavior for directly expressing the arity of curried functions. And these extensional functions can stand side-by-side with functions native to practical programming languages, which do not use call-by-name evaluation. Integrating call-by-name with other evaluation strategies in the same intermediate language expresses the arity of a function in its type and gives a principled and compositional account of multi-argument curried functions. An unexpected, but significant, bonus is that our approach is equally suitable for a call-by-value language and a call-by-need language, and it can be readily integrated into an existing compilation framework.},

In addition, bidirectional typing improves error locality. We highlight the design principles that underlie bidirectional type systems, survey the development of bidirectional typing from the prehistoric period before Pierce and Turner's local type inference to the present day, and provide guidance for future investigations.},

This results in a monadic framework for typed and encapsulated delimited continuations, which we design and implement as a Haskell library.},

  abstract = {Build systems are used in all but the smallest software projects to invoke the right build tools on the right files in the right order. A build system must be sound (after a build, generated files consistently reflect the latest source files) and efficient (recheck and rebuild as few build units as possible). Contemporary build systems provide limited efficiency because they lack support for expressing finegrained file dependencies. We present a build system called pluto that supports the definition of reusable, parameterized, interconnected builders. When run, a builder notifies the build system about dynamically required and produced files as well as about other builders whose results are needed. To support fine-grained file dependencies, we generalize the traditional notion of time stamps to allow builders to declare their actual requirements on a fileâs content. pluto collects the requirements and products of a builder with their stamps in a build summary. This enables pluto to provides provably sound and optimal incremental rebuilding. To support dynamic dependencies, our rebuild algorithm interleaves dependency analysis and builder execution and enforces invariants on the dependency graph through a dynamic analysis. We have developed pluto as a Java API and used it to implement more than 25 builders. We describe our experience with migrating a larger Ant build script to pluto and compare the respective build times.},

We provide two pieces of evidence for our thesis that the jumbo formulation is advantageous.Firstly, we show that the jumbo lambda-calculus provides a âcompleteâ range of connectives, in the sense of including every possible connective that, within the beta-eta theory, possesses a reversible rule.Secondly, in the presence of effects, we show that there is no decomposition of jumbo connectives into non-jumbo ones that is valid in both call-by-value and call-by-name.},

  abstract = {Software testing is one of the costliest stages in the software development life cycle. One approach to reducing the test execution cost is to group changes and test them as a batch (i.e. batch testing). However, when tests fail in a batch, commits in the batch need to be re-tested to identify the cause of the failure, i.e. the culprit commit. The re-testing is typically done through bisection (i.e. a binary search through the commits in a batch). Intuitively, the effectiveness of batch testing highly depends on the size of the batch. Larger batches require fewer initial test runs, but have a higher chance of a test failure that can lead to expensive test re-runs to find the culprit. We are unaware of research that investigates and simulates the impact of batch sizes on the cost of testing in industry. In this work, we first conduct empirical studies on the effectiveness of batch testing in three large-scale industrial software systems at Ericsson. Using 9 months of testing data, we simulate batch sizes from 1 to 20 and find the most cost-effective BatchSize for each project. Our results show that batch testing saves 72\% of test executions compared to testing each commit individually. In a second simulation, we incorporate flaky tests that pass and fail on the same commit as they are a significant source of additional test executions on large projects. We model the degree of flakiness for each project and find that test flakiness reduces the cost savings to 42\%. In a third simulation, we guide bisection to reduce the likelihood of batch-testing failures. We model the riskiness of each commit in a batch using a bug model and a test execution history model. The risky commits are tested individually, while the less risky commits are tested in a single larger batch. Culprit predictions with our approach reduce test executions up to 9\% compared to Ericssonâs current bisection approach.},

  . This inference task is usually called smoothing. The algorithm makes use of the principle of dynamic programming to efficiently compute the values that are required to obtain the posterior marginal distributions in two passes. The first pass goes forward in time while the second goes backward in time; hence the name forwardâbackward algorithm.
The term forwardâbackward algorithm is also used to refer to any algorithm belonging to the general class of algorithms that operate on sequence models in a forwardâbackward manner. In this sense, the descriptions in the remainder of this article refer but to one specific instance of this class.},
