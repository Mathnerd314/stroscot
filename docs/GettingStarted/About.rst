Executive summary
=================

..
  An executive summary is "half a slide using large print" (128 x's) and gets across how people should use the language.

Stroscot targets unoccupied programming enthusiasts. Feel free to improve the design WIP and maybe send a pull request.

Roadmap
=======

The roadmap at the moment is, in vaguely the expected order of finishing:

* build system
* static analysis/optimization (includes memory management)
* finish up core IR
* pass tower of interpreters test
* cool parser with fexprs
* x86-64 compiler backend
* "lots of people make assumptions about the language based on sample code and complain without checking to see if those complaints were valid."
* World domination

Code of Conduct
===============

ZOMG there's none!

Not an un-CoC like `NCoC <https://github.com/domgetter/NCoC>`_, just that I haven't got around to writing one down yet. No point in doing it until there is an actual community to conduct. I like the `FIRE code of conduct <https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/model-code-student-conduct>`__ but it needs at least 10 people to fill in the different roles.

License
=======

Currently the main license is WTFPL, because I haven't gotten around to picking a real license and WTFPL annoys people and is avoided by large companies such as Google. Apache 2.0, MIT, and BSD are all good candidates for a real license. The license was Apache 2 briefly, switching back to that is probably the most likely outcome. License for contributing is CC0 until a real license gets picked, to allow relicensing.
