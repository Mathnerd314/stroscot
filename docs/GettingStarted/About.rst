Executive summary
=================

..
  An executive summary is "half a slide using large print" (128 x's) and gets across how people should use the language.

Stroscot targets unoccupied programming enthusiasts. Feel free to improve the design WIP and maybe send a pull request.

Roadmap
=======

The roadmap at the moment is, in no particular order:

* build system
* static analysis/optimization (includes memory management)
* finish up core IR
* pass tower of interpreters test
* cool parser with fexprs
* x86-64 compiler backend
* "lots of people make assumptions about the language based on sample code and complain without checking to see if those complaints were valid."
* World domination

Statistics
==========

* `Bus factor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor>`__: 1
* 10k lines of code
* ~1 commit/month
* `First commit <https://github.com/Mathnerd314/stroscot/tree/a5264d6697f3e4a4034c4acc87c2a2022070a2bc>`__: December 2018

Code of Conduct
===============

ZOMG there's none!

Not an un-CoC like `NCoC <https://github.com/domgetter/NCoC>`_, just that I haven't got around to picking one yet.

License
=======

Currently the license is WTFPL, because I haven't gotten around to picking a real license. It might switch back to Apache 2, IDK.
