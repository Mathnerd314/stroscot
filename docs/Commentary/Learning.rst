Learning
########

There is clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date documentation. It is easy for developers experienced with other languages to get started. There is a large and active community of users providing guidance and support. Programs run quickly and scale well. It is easy for experienced developers to understand and maintain programs.

Learning a language takes time and effort. Typically, programmers are pressed for time, so the goal would be to learn a "minimum viable amount" of Stroscot in a short period of time. As a project, Stroscot should provide resources to help programmers learn Stroscot efficiently and in as pleasant a manner as possible.

Formats
=======

Learning content can be provided in different ways:

* Books: Books provide comprehensive and structured learning material. They often offer in-depth explanations, examples, exercises, and best practices. How long should it be? A `121 page Python book (60 pages double spaced) <https://www.amazon.com/Python-Programming-Beginners-Comprehensive-Hands/dp/B0BFV21L24/>`__ is derided as terse and useless, requiring to google every new keyword. `K&R C <https://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Language-2nd-Edition/dp/0131103628/>`__ has 272 pages, but is "not beginner friendly". The `C# Programming Yellow Book <http://www.csharpcourse.com/>`__  is 217 8.5x11 pages or about 322 of the standard 7x9 pages. `Python for Kids <https://www.amazon.com/Python-Kids-Playful-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593274076/>`__ clocks in at 344 pages but is still missing critical functions such as the input command. On the other hand some chapters such as turtle graphics, tkinter, and classes/objects can be skipped (74 pages). My first programming book `Beginning Programming with Java For Dummies <https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Programming-Java-Dummies-Computers/dp/0764526464/>`__ had 408 pages. The `5th edition <https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Programming-Java-Dummies-Computer/dp/1119235537/>`__ is the most popular and has 560 pages. But it still only covers the basics. `Head First Java <https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-2nd-Edition/dp/0596009208/>`__ is recommended by the r/learnprogramming subreddit and has 688 pages.

* Online Tutorials: They can provide step-by-step instructions, code samples, and practical examples.

* Official language documentation: Useful for quick reference and learning about more specialized topics. For when people don't want to read the code.

* Video Courses: Video courses offer visual and auditory learning experiences. mainly in the form of lectures and coding examples.

* Quizzes: Some basic tests allow quickly identifying areas where one's knowledge is deficient.

* Interactive Coding Exercises: Online platforms that offer interactive coding exercises, challenges, and projects can be highly effective for learning by doing. These platforms provide a hands-on learning experience where you can write, run, and test code directly in a web browser. They often offer immediate feedback and guidance to reinforce learning.

* Communities and Forums: Participating in chats, communities and forums can be a valuable learning resource. Engaging with peers, mentors, and experts allows you to ask questions, seek guidance, and learn from others' experiences. It's a great way to stay updated with the latest trends and best practices, if other resources are not sufficient.

Make sure the resources are high-quality, up-to-date, and relevant to the version of the programming language you'll be using.





Others recommend skipping the "dead tree" format altogether and watching videos on YouTube or doing educational courses on edX, Udacity, and Coursera. On YouTube `MIT
6.0001 <https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/video_galleries/lecture-videos/>` is around 12x45=540 minutes. `CS50P <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T3817j24-GogXmWqO5Q5vYy0V>`__ is 14x1.2=1005 minutes. The amateur `CS Dojo <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBZBJbE_rGRWeh5mIBhD-hhDwSEDxogDg>` is 16x~13=217 minutes. `Digilent Inc.'s course <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0845FEB57E5894C2>`__ is 87x6.5=561 minutes. Coursera's `Learn to program <https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program>`__ course is 291 minutes or less than 5 hours of video content but there are 43 readings and Coursera says it will take 25 hours to complete.

Learning a new language can be faster if you already know a language, but you can also bring over preconceptions. For example in :cite:`joostenTeachingFunctionalProgramming1993`, imperative gotchas became misconceptions in functional programming: variables can be defined after they are used, operators like ``tail``, ``take``, ``drop``, ``remove``, ``filter`` do not mutate their arguments, and there is no need to clone results to prevent them from being mutated and corrupted. It's not clear what can be done - people hate UI changes, and will complain when their cherished workarounds no longer work, even if they are now unnecessary. `Dijkstra <https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd04xx/EWD498.PDF>`__ similarly stated that COBOL "cripples the mind" and BASIC "mentally mutilates programmers beyond hope of regeneration", presumably because they give the programmer the wrong impression of what programming is. Still though, Dijkstra is too pessimistic - a simple "Stroscot for Y programmers" guide series should be sufficient to retrain programmers away from their bad habits.

TODO: check out the Unified Learning Model book

Immersion is by far the best way to learn anything. And as research shows, it turns out that humans retain:

    5% of what they learn when they’ve learned from a lecture.
    10% of what they learn when they’ve learned from reading.
    20% of what they learn from audio-visual.
    30% of what they learn when they see a demonstration
    50% of what they learn when engaged in a group discussion.
    75% of what they learn when they practice what they learned.
    90% of what they learn when they use it immediately.

Think back to how you learned to play basketball, ride a bicycle, or swim. Instead of watching tutorial videos or reading a textbook on how to do something, the way to learn faster is to get into the trenches and gain experience through making mistakes.


Even if the learning material is there, what will convince people to invest the time to give it a try?
