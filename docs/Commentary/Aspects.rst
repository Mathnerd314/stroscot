Aspects
#######

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that allows separating concerns (aspects) that cut across multiple modules or components. Used properly, AOP increases codebase modularity, maintainability, reusability, readability, consistency, and testability. In particular, developers may isolate business logic, and separately manage cross-cutting aspects which would otherwise be spread across different parts of the code. These aspects can even be dynamically managed, providing flexibility to enable or disable certain behaviors at runtime without altering the core application logic.

Costs and benefits
==================

Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) has shown significant benefits and practical applications in software development. However, it has a significant learning curve. First there is the new terminology, such as aspects, join points, pointcuts, and advice. AOP introduces a different code organization, and identifying the actual flow of code can be difficult amongst the many "weaved" aspects and advice. A debugger can trace an existing program, but recognizing which parts of a new program are suitable for aspect extraction can be tricky. There is also a general lack of tooling support for AOP.

To help developers overcome these challenges, it's important to provide comprehensive resources, documentation, tutorials, and examples that explain AOP concepts clearly. Hands-on practice with small, manageable projects can also help developers gain confidence and proficiency in using AOP. Additionally, offering mentoring or training sessions can accelerate the learning process by addressing developers' questions and concerns directly. Over time, as developers become more familiar with AOP concepts and practices, the learning curve becomes less steep, and the benefits of AOP can become more evident in their development workflows.

AOP can also introduce some performance overhead, although most studies have actually found a performance increase.

Uses
====

AOP has been successfully applied in various domains: detailed logging. authentication and authorization checks, error-handling logic, caching, proper initiation, commit, or rollback procedures for transactions. and performance monitoring.

Structure
=========

Designing a programming language with native support for aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a complex endeavor, but here are the key features you should consider incorporating into your language to ensure robust and native AOP support:

1. **Aspect Declaration**: Introduce a syntax to declare aspects explicitly. Aspects define cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, security, or transaction management.

2. **Join Points**: Identify specific points in the code where aspects can be applied. These points include method calls, field access, object instantiation, and more.

3. **Pointcuts**: Define pointcuts to specify which join points in the codebase the aspect should be applied to. Pointcuts can be based on method signatures, class hierarchies, annotations, or other criteria.

4. **Advice**: Implement different types of advice that dictate what should happen at a specific join point. Common advice types include "before," "after," "around," "after-returning," and "after-throwing."

5. **Weaving**: Incorporate a mechanism for weaving, which is the process of integrating aspects into the main codebase. There are two main weaving approaches: compile-time weaving and runtime weaving. Both approaches require careful integration of aspects into the target code.

6. **Aspect Variables**: Allow aspects to define and use variables that can store information relevant to the aspect's context. These variables can be accessed and modified within the aspect's advice.

7. **Aspect Collaboration**: Enable communication and collaboration between aspects. Aspects might need to interact with each other, share information, or coordinate actions.

8. **Aspect Inheritance**: Consider how aspects should be inherited or composed when classes or aspects are extended. This involves deciding whether subclasses inherit aspects from their parent classes and how conflicts or ambiguities are resolved.

9. **Aspect Lifecycle**: Define how aspects are instantiated, managed, and destroyed during the runtime of the application. Consider aspects' initialization, activation, deactivation, and cleanup.

10. **Cross-Cutting Relationships**: Allow aspects to define relationships and dependencies with other aspects. This might involve specifying the order in which aspects should be applied or controlling which aspects can override others.

11. **Error Handling and Reporting**: Implement mechanisms to handle errors and exceptions that might occur during the application of aspects. Clear error messages and debugging tools can help developers identify and fix issues in their aspect code.

12. **Introspection and Reflection**: Provide APIs or mechanisms for aspects to inspect and manipulate the target codebase. This can be useful for aspects that require runtime analysis of the program's structure.

13. **Scoping**: Define how the scope of an aspect's influence is determined. Aspects might apply to specific methods, classes, packages, or even broader application contexts.

14. **Performance Optimization**: Consider performance implications of aspect application. Some aspects might introduce overhead, so providing mechanisms to optimize or selectively apply aspects can be beneficial.

15. **Integration with IDEs and Tooling**: Develop tooling and IDE plugins that assist developers in writing, visualizing, and debugging aspects. This can include syntax highlighting, code completion, and visual representations of aspect interactions.

16. **Documentation and Training**: Provide comprehensive documentation and resources to help developers understand and effectively use the AOP features of your language.


1. **Modularity and Separation of Concerns**: AOP excels at separating cross-cutting concerns, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code. This can be especially beneficial for large and complex software projects.

2. **Code Reusability**: AOP allows for the reuse of aspects across different parts of the application, reducing duplication and promoting consistent behavior.

3. **Readability and Maintainability**: By isolating concerns, AOP improves code readability by removing the clutter of concern-related code from the main logic.

4. **Dynamic Behavior**: AOP's ability to dynamically apply or remove aspects at runtime offers flexibility and adaptability.

5. **Consistency and Centralization**: AOP enables centralized management of concerns, ensuring that changes to these concerns are made in one place.

6. **Potential for Productivity**: For projects with complex cross-cutting concerns, AOP can streamline development by providing a systematic way to handle them.


* aspect-oriented programming: a join point is an imperative action (with continuation included). A point cut is a predicate over join points. Advice is a transformation of an imperative program at the set of join points in a certain point cut. For example Stroscot's destructors are implemented this way. AOP goes further in exposing (non-side-effectful) method calls as join points.

It is a requirement that any structural additions be compatible with the original class, so that clients of the existing class continue to operate, unless the AOP implementation can expect to control all clients at all times.


 this is based on pointcuts, treating imperative actions as data.
