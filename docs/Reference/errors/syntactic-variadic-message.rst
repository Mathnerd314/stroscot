Variadic function 'c' was applied but did not return a function, so expression cannot be applied to argument '3'. I suggest making '3' a syntactic argument of 'c'.

Function 'a' applied variadic function 'c' but did not return a function, so expression cannot be applied to argument '2' in function 'b'. I suggest adding a parameter to 'a'.
