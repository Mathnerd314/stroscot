# The Stroscot Programming Language

Stroscot is an imperative programming language designed for modern processors.

See https://mathnerd314.github.io/stroscot/ for more details and documentation.

## Layout

* docs - main website, generated with Sphinx
* extern - external projects that may prove useful for the build system
* glue - random notes/pseudocode on various aspects
* library - sketches of some standard library aspects
* src - optimal reduction (core) prototype and imports of some external projects
* tests - smaller Haskell experiments and test cases

## Status

Experimental, nothing really works yet.
