<h1>Checklist<a class="headerlink" href="#checklist" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>This page goes through programming paradigms, principles of language design, and discusses a selection of other programming languages.</p>
<section id="paradigms">
<h2>Paradigms<a class="headerlink" href="#paradigms" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The programming languages checklist has a few paradigms: functional, imperative, object-oriented, procedural, stack-based, “multi-paradigm”. In linguistics, a paradigm is “a set of linguistic items that form mutually exclusive choices in particular syntactic roles,” specifically “a table of all the inflected forms of a particular verb, noun, or adjective.” This seems to be a usable definition of a PL paradigm - you have all related versions of a semantic entity.</p>
<p>Unfortunately people seem to use paradigms as labels of entire languages, rather than to refer to individual syntactic features. Stroscot, like every other language, is “multi-paradigm” - even assembly is multi-paradigm since it is imperative (syscalls) and structured (conditional jump). So the adjectives “object-oriented”, “functional”, etc. are avoided outside of this page in favor of the specific semantic constructs, since “functional object-oriented language” sounds weird. Still, it’s good to have a map from paradigms to constructs, and to know which constructs embed into which other constructs. This list is based on Wikipedia’s <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Programming_paradigms&amp;oldid=1114006717">list of paradigms</a>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Action: <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_language">action descriptions</a> are given by the state trajectory relation</p></li>
<li><p>Array-oriented functions are still functions</p></li>
<li><p>Automata-based:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Nondeterministic automata are given by a transition relation.</p></li>
<li><p>Deterministic automata are given by a transition relation that is a function.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>concurrency - concurrent programs are given as imperative programs that use concurrent operations</p>
<ul>
<li><p>agents/actors/flow-based processes are threads with a main dispatch loop</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>data-driven programming is a main loop over condition-action pairs</p></li>
<li><p>declarative is a logical relation or a function</p>
<ul>
<li><p>functional - functions are total functional binary relations</p>
<ul>
<li><p>lambas are anonymous functions</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>logic - a logical relation is a set of tuples</p>
<ul>
<li><p>boolean operations are logical constraints, i.e. relations over a certain domain</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>constraint: constraints are 0-1 loss functions in an optimization problem</p></li>
<li><p>dataflow is a block in single static assignment form</p></li>
<li><p>a reactive or incremental program is a state value plus a state update function or command</p></li>
<li><p>a query is a function that takes a database and produces a list of results</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>differentiable: the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_derivative">derivative</a> is a function mapping a function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> to a linear operator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> such that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lim _{\|h\|\to 0}{\frac {\|f(x+h)-f(x)-Ah\|}{\|h\|}}=0\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>dynamic: eval is a function from strings to values (and optionally with an environment)</p></li>
<li><p>event driven: an ED program is some event handler functions, data binding event handlers to events, and a main loop function (provided by a library) that repeatedly checks for events and calls the matching event handler</p></li>
<li><p>generic functions are just functions over a large domain</p></li>
<li><p>imperative programing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>commands can be represented as a tag (payload) plus a callback function returning another command</p></li>
<li><p>mutable variables are using read and modify functions on an implicitly passed/returned store.</p></li>
<li><p>procedures are functions from arguments to commands</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Metaprogramming:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Attribute-oriented: attributes are a function from symbols to metadata</p></li>
<li><p>Macros: macros are functions that take an AST and a lexical environment</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Nondeterministic: a nondeterministic function is a relation</p></li>
<li><p>Parallel: a block in single static assignment form can be easily parallelized using a concurrent worker pool</p></li>
<li><p>Process-oriented programs can be represented using concurrent operations</p></li>
<li><p>probabilistic programs are functions from parameters to a log probability</p></li>
<li><p>Quantum:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>quantum logic gates are functions, in particular unitary operators on states of qubits</p></li>
<li><p>a quantum program is a block, consisting of gate applications and discarding information (Qunity)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Set-theoretic: set membership is a boolean predicate function</p></li>
<li><p>Stack-based: a stack-oriented program is a function on stacks, a.k.a. lists</p></li>
<li><p>structured:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>loops are recursive functions</p></li>
<li><p>conditionals are lazy functions</p></li>
<li><p>Block-structured: block sequencing is Kleisli arrow composition, a function</p></li>
<li><p>Object-oriented: objects are mutable variables containing records of mutable variables and functions</p></li>
<li><p>Class-based: classes are types</p></li>
<li><p>recursion is syntax for applying a fixpoint function</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Symbolic: an AST is a value</p></li>
<li><p>Value-level: types are sets</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition I’ve found some other paradigms too obscure for the WP list:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>term rewriting systems are given by the rewriting relation</p></li>
<li><p>optimization problems are relations based on on objective functions</p></li>
<li><p>optimization solvers are functions from objective functions to a list of solutions</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Graphviz has chosen “function” as the central paradigm. This agrees well with experience. Quoting <a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Calculus/7JKVu_9InRUC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=central%20objects">Spivak</a>, “the most important concept in all of mathematics is that of a function - in almost every branch of modern mathematics functions turn out to be the central objects of investigation.” Looking closer, function is part of an SCC <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">function,</span> <span class="pre">relation,</span> <span class="pre">set,</span> <span class="pre">boolean,</span> <span class="pre">constraint,</span> <span class="pre">optimization</span></code>. Although lambdas provide a natural way to express many functions, the mathematical notion of function is broader than just lambdas - some mathematically definable functions have no efficient/constructive algorithm and are instead specified as a logical relation or optimization predicate. So we need constraint logic programming as well to get the full notion of “function”. Hence the ultimate paradigm is functional logic programming. Thus, Stroscot is at its core designed to be a functional logic programming language, but with support for many other programming paradigms implemented via the embeddings described above.</p>

<section id="principles">
<h2>Principles<a class="headerlink" href="#principles" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Paradigms are vague and only express common patterns or features; they cannot be used to determine the specific design of those features. So instead we have principles. What are these principles actually useful for? Mainly wasting time. Practical decisions are are made by judging pros and cons and these general principles are hard to apply.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different. The good poet welds his theft into a whole of feeling which is unique, utterly different than that from which it is torn. (T. S. Eliot)</p></li>
<li><p>Make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience. (Albert Einstein)</p></li>
<li><p>Write a prototype implementation. Conduct an A* search through the possible solutions, stopping early if the potential solution is clearly worse than the prototype. Periodically take the best solution out of all discovered so far and implement it as the new prototype. (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound">Branch and bound</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Never finished, never complete, but tracking the progress of technology (Lennart Poettering)</p></li>
<li><p>Design to do the hard things every day. Take all the common daily tasks considered to be painful and hard, and figure out a design that will allow each task to be accomplished efficiently in a few seconds of actual work. It is unacceptable to require detailed pre-planning or coordination for each task. The biggest overheads should be testing the result and writing documentation. (Linus on <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170920135205/https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/10-years-of-git-an-interview-with-git-creator-linus-torvalds/">why Git works so well</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>As size and complexity increase, architectural design dominates materials. Create durable, non-leaky, beautiful interfaces. (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2011004_steps11.pdf">VPRI</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/666">John Regehr</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>If it isn’t documented, it doesn’t exist (Coding Horror). Corollary: There is no undefined behavior, only undocumented behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a list of items. Imagine a specific walk through a familiar place. List distinctive features of the route. Combine each feature with an item to form new outrageous/memorable images. (Memory palace)</p></li>
<li><p>People prefer a middle level of complexity: too simple and we are bored, too complex and we are confused. Moreover, the ideal level of complexity is a moving target, because the more expert we become at any subject, the more complexity we prefer. (Donald Norman)</p></li>
<li><p>Better depends on your goodness metric (<a class="reference external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210325222034/https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=24807">Jim Waldo</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The shorter the [edit-test] cycle, the happier the programmer. (<a class="reference external" href="https://tripack45.github.io/2018/11/03/edit-compile-run/">Yue Yao</a>)</p>
<p>Per <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060213015737/http://blogs.msdn.com/peterhal/archive/2006/01/04/509302.aspx">here</a>, the cycle time can be broken down into 70% Understanding Code, 25% Modifying Existing Code, 5% Writing New Code. In particular we estimate that there is 14x as much read time as write time. But this estimate is probably only appropriate for application code - the true average varies depending on scenario. Per APL, if a language is quick to program in, it may be faster to write small programs from scratch than to read and understand another person’s program. So the 70/25/5 may turn into something more like 50/20/30 in a scripting context, only a 1.6x read-write factor. On the other hand, common library functions may be read many times but only modified or added rarely, giving read/write factors of 100x, 1000x, or more.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do all things without grumbling or complaining (Philippians 2:14)</p></li>
<li><p>Secure by default: The default level of access should have the least privilege and the most number of checks. (OpenBSD)</p></li>
<li><p>Organize functions by functionality into expressive components. (<a class="reference external" href="https://reasoncodeexample.com/2016/03/06/a-place-for-everything-and-everything-in-its-place-thoughts-on-organizing-source-code-by-type/">Uli Weltersbach</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>When an interface has multiple possibilities, and other principles conflict or are ambiguous, the behavior should be that which will least surprise most new novice users. In particular the behavior is not necessarily the behavior that would be the most easily implemented. (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">POLA</a>)</p>
<p>This principle varies from the original in specifically defining a target audience (new novice users). Targeting other audiences such as existing programmers would make the language highly dependent upon the whims of culture, and create a vicious circle of learning (“To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion”). For contrast, per Matsumoto’s <a class="reference external" href="https://www.artima.com/articles/the-philosophy-of-ruby">interview</a>, Ruby was designed for <em>his</em> least surprise. That means that, in order to feel comfortable with Ruby, one must learn all of Ruby, program a few large programs in Ruby, and then constantly re-read the Ruby manual to refresh what has been forgotten. And even then you are not Matsumoto so there may be something that surprises you. Focusing on novices means that all an expert has to do is “think like an idiot” and the solution will be at hand. The expectations of novices are essentially constant over time, because they depend on human psychology rather than experience. This principle is essentially the approach taken in designing the Quorum programming language. Every person goes through a short “what is this feature” phase, which novice-friendly syntax will make straightforward, followed by a much longer cycle of routine reading and writing for which the syntax makes no difference.</p>

<h4>Minimalism<a class="headerlink" href="#minimalism" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Generally minimalism is bad. If you build on an existing language but include no new features, then there’s no incentive to use your language. If your language uses a minimal set of operations like Brainfuck, figuring out how to express programs in it will be difficult, and the resulting encoding most likely will be incomprehensible. Providing a broad set of features will mean that the language is suitable for whatever project someone is thinking about. What is worthwhile is Albert Einstein’s principle to form what is essentially a basis in the vector space of programs, a collection of “orthogonal features” (although there is no obvious interpretation of the norm-1 constraint of an). This does not mean giving up features, but rather “dissolving” redundant features that can be naturally expressed using other features by putting them in the standard library rather than the core language.</p>

<section id="familiarity">
<h4>Familiarity<a class="headerlink" href="#familiarity" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>There is a quote from Grace Hopper, “The most dangerous phrase [one] can say is ‘We’ve always done it that way’.” According to <cite>some guy &lt;https://medium.com/geekculture/3-busted-myths-about-the-35-hour-week-that-you-should-present-to-your-boss-efa5403bb263&gt;</cite> the golden rule at his university was that anyone who said that phrase was a lousy engineer. Hopper <cite>continues &lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=3u9H-xL4sZAC&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;vq=%22most%20dangerous%22&amp;pg=PA9#v=snippet&amp;q=%22most%20dangerous%22&amp;f=false&gt;`__</cite>: “If we base our plans on the present, we fall behind and the cost of carrying out something may be more costly than not implementing it. But there is a line. If you step over it, you don’t get the budget. However, you must come as close to it as you can. And you must keep pushing the line out further. We must not only accept new concepts, we must manage their development and growth.”</p>
<p>Per <a class="reference external" href="https://soc.me/languages/familiarity">Simon</a>, C’s operator precedence, C++’s use of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;&gt;</span></code> for generics, and C#’s design of properties are all examples of suboptimal, legacy decisions. They were designed based on limited information but in hindsight it has become clear that better choices exist. Nonetheless they continue to be adopted by new languages on the basis of “familiarity” - people are so used to the suboptimal behavior that they will complain if it changes.</p>
<p>For Stroscot, is it worth repeating these mistakes for the benefit of “familiarity”? Familiarity will not help when</p>
<p>Let us consider the various adopted principles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>stealing ideas - we should understand why these choices were made, and consider if those reasons are still valid. For C’s operator precedence, there is essentially no basis - it is just historical baggage.</p></li>
<li><p>irreducible elements - do we need these operators at all? Probably so, because they are in these other languages and people have used these languages for a while. But it is just syntax, so extensible syntax is sufficient - it does not have to be part of the language core.</p></li>
<li><p>branch and bound - this says we should aim for the optimal choice, but first we have to define optimal</p></li>
<li><p>Poettering - he broke your audio. I think he’d decide to break your programming habits too</p></li>
<li><p>Productivity - these sorts of syntax decisions are minor annoyances, so don’t really impact the ability to accomplish things</p></li>
<li><p>Beautiful interfaces - a consistent interface is more beautiful than a broken one</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation - whatever the choice, the process for arriving at it should be clearly written down</p></li>
<li><p>Memory palace - a consistent interface is also easier to remember</p></li>
<li><p>Medium complexity: programming is hard enough by itself, the language doesn’t need to be more complex</p></li>
<li><p>Goodness metric: these principles are sort of subjective, but I don’t know what else to use</p></li>
<li><p>Edit-test cycle: Experienced Stroscot programmers will get tripped up because it’s a bad choice. Novice programmers will be slow regardless. Expert programmers from other languages may have to invest more time in learning the language.</p></li>
<li><p>Philippians: With the good decision, expert programmers from other languages may complain due to change aversion. But nobody who uses Stroscot for a significant amount of time will complain. With the bad decision, complaints will come in forever.</p></li>
<li><p>Secure by default: It is possible to avoid operator precedence by requiring parentheses all the time. This is safer as nobody will be confused.</p></li>
<li><p>Organize:</p></li>
<li><p>Least astonishment: we should aim for “the behavior that will least surprise someone who uses the program”. , rather than that behavior that is natural from knowing the inner workings of the program. (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">POLA</a>)</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Ideally, changes will get so fed up that they will post “ragequit” posts to social media. So long as discussion can point to a solid basis for the changes, these will most likely serve to draw positive attention to the language. Anybody who uses the language for a while will get used to it. And actually the people who are willing to learn a new language are likely looking for something new and are willing to adapt, so they won’t ragequit. Succinct migration guides for users from various popular languages will get these users up to speed.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>There is another sense of familiarity though in the sense of creating a “brand” for the language. Some languages take this in the sense of not allowing any room for major changes in the design once the language reaches a beta. Minor migrations would be possible, but for example switching from curried to uncurried functions would be forbidden because they would annoy too many people. This requires doing essentially all of the designing up-front. I’m kind of split on this. On the one hand, there is the “durable” part of the “create interfaces” principle -</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Another important concept is being intuitive/memorable, as can be tested via cloze completion and “what does this piece of code do”. Ideally someone should be able to read the manual and write some throwaway Stroscot code, abandon Stroscot for 6 months, and then come back and correctly type out some new Stroscot code without having to look at the manual again. If Stroscot the language is a moving target this goal is difficult to accomplish. That being said though, like Poettering said nothing is ever finished and it is better to track the progress of technology.</p>

<section id="readability">
<h4>Readability<a class="headerlink" href="#readability" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Using the literal definition, “ease of understanding code”, readability is included as part of the edit-test cycle time principle. Cycle time has the benefit of being a lot more empirical. Most articles that discuss readability go on to describe “readable code”, defined by various properties:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Meaningful variable and function names (“self-commenting”)</p></li>
<li><p>Consistent identifier style, indentation, and spacing</p></li>
<li><p>Comments that explain the purpose of each function</p></li>
<li><p>Comments that explain non-obvious parts</p></li>
<li><p>Intermediate variables to avoid complex expressions</p></li>
<li><p>Intermediate functions to avoid deep nesting of control structures and ensure each function has a single purpose</p></li>
<li><p>Parentheses that make the order of operations clear</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These definitions are somewhat subjective and unreliable: what makes a name meaningful? Should the identifier style be camel case or snake case? With a loose reading, most libraries and style guides qualify as readable, in that there is always somebody who will argue that the existing choice is the best. The cycle time principle provides a framework for evaluating these choices objectively, although it is still dependent on a subject pool and hence the scientific literature. In fact studies have validated many of these guidelines as empirically reducing time to understand, and in cases such as underscores vs camel case found a definitive benefit for underscores.</p>
<p>Cycle time also accounts for the aphorism “Perfect is the enemy of good”. One could spend hours optimizing for readability by fixing spelling mistakes and other nits and not get anything useful done. In the time it takes to write a long descriptive comment or poll coworkers for a meaningful variable name, one could have skipped writing comments, used 1-letter names, run and debugged the code, and moved on to a new task. Perfect readability is not the goal - the code just has to be understandable enough that any further readability improvements would take more cycle time than they will save in the future. And with hyperbolic discounting, reducing future maintenance effort is generally not as important as shipping working code now. This calculation does flip though when considering the programming language syntax and standard library, where small readability improvements can save time for millions of programmers (assuming the language becomes popular, so there is again a discounting factor).</p>

<section id="terseness">
<h4>Terseness<a class="headerlink" href="#terseness" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>APL is terse mainly due to its use of symbols, and <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="../zzreferences.html#id74" title="W. N. Holmes. Is APL a Programming Language? The Computer Journal, 21(2):128–131, May 1978. URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/21.2.128 (visited on 2022-12-01), doi:10.1093/comjnl/21.2.128.">Hol78</a>]</span> mentions that some consider terseness an advantage. But is it really? Again the principle for Stroscot is the edit-test cycle time, in particular the 70% of time needed to understand a program. An APL program may be short but if the APL program requires looking up symbols in a vocabulary while a normal word-based program is more verbose but self-contained, then the word-based program wins on cycle time.</p>
<p>Iverson argues the human mind has a limit on how many symbols it can cope with at one time. A terser notation allows larger problems to be comprehended and worked with. But this ignores the role of chunking: a novice chess player works with individual pieces, while an expert player works with configurations of the entire board. Similarly a programming expert will work on the level of program fragments, for example CRUD or the design patterns of Java, and the amount of verbiage involved in writing such patterns is immaterial to mental manipulation but rather only becomes relevant in the time necessary to read unfamiliar codebases and comprehend their patterns and the time needed to write out such verbose patterns when moving to implementation. Rather than terseness, this consideration argues to make programming patterns easy to recognize (distinctive) and easy to remember (the “memory palace” principle). APL’s overloading of monadic and dyadic function symbols seems to conflate distinct functions and go against this consideration.</p>
<p>There is some advantage to terseness in that shorter code listings can be published more easily in books or blog posts, as inline snippets that do not detract from the flow of the text. Documentation works better when the commentary and the code are visible on the same medium. But readability of the code is more important - a barcode is terse but provides no help without a complicated scanning procedure. Web UX design provides many techniques for creating navigable code listings, e.g. a 1000-line listings to be discussed in a short note with a hyperlink. Accordion folds can be used for 100-line listings, and 10-line listings can be in a two-column format or with a collapsed accordion fold. So this advantage of terseness seems minimal when considering that code is mostly published on the web these days.</p>

<h4>Turtles all the way down<a class="headerlink" href="#turtles-all-the-way-down" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>This is an Ecstasy principle. But it’s misleading - going infinitely downward would require infinite space. Actually it is a finite list plus a trick to make it infinite, namely that the objects at some point refer back to themselves. This pointing trick is the useful part, hence why Stroscot supports infinite structures. But this sort of “can you do this trick?” question is covered by the productivity principle.</p>

<h4>Remember the Vasa<a class="headerlink" href="#remember-the-vasa" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Bjarne Stroustrup <a class="reference external" href="https://www.stroustrup.com/P0977-remember-the-vasa.pdf">seems fond</a> of the phrase “Remember the Vasa” to warn against large last-minute changes. According to <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship)">Wikipedia</a>, the Vasa was a ship that sunk because the center of gravity was too high. Despite rumors that it was redesigned, there is no evidence that any alterations were performed during construction. It appears to have been built exactly as its designer Henrik Hybertsson envisioned it. And the design was obviously incorrect - a survey of shipwrights at the inquest after the sinking said the ship design “didn’t have enough belly”. So the only lesson I get is to learn from experienced designers to avoid making mistakes. But this is just T.S. Eliot’s principle to steal from great poets.</p>

<section id="hungarian-notation">
<h4>Hungarian notation<a class="headerlink" href="#hungarian-notation" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Hungarian notation puts abbreviated type annotations in variable names, so humans can check that the types are correct. But the compiler already checks declared types, automatically and much more thoroughly. So in the end it is noise. Mathematicians do use single-letter variables with subscripts, but these do not encode types, they are just abbreviations - e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code> stands for “first coordinate”. Per <a class="reference external" href="https://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq2.html#Hungarian">Stroustrup</a> it is “a maintenance hazard and a serious detriment to good code. Avoid it as the plague.”</p>

<section id="the-ultimate">
<h3>The ultimate<a class="headerlink" href="#the-ultimate" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Stroscot aims to be the ultimate programming language, rather than something just alright. The goal is to win the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDXYfulsRBA">ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny</a> w.r.t. programming languages. This has been called “silly” by Dennis Ritchie (author of C) and “the dream of immature programmers” by Bjarne Stroustrup (author of C++), <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="../zzreferences.html#id153" title="Herb Sutter. The C Family of Languages. Java Report, July 2000. URL: http://www.gotw.ca/publications/c_family_interview.htm (visited on 2021-10-28).">Sut00</a>]</span> but I think it can be made to work. To bring in an analogy with weapons, the question of which firearm is strongest is quite subjective and a matter of debate, due to loading and capacity questions. But the Tsar Bomba is without question the strongest weapon in history. In this analogy Stroscot would be an early nuke prototype.</p>
<p>Stroustrup claims there are “genuine design choices and tradeoffs” to consider, which I agree with to a point. Many queries in a compiler are too expensive to compute exactly and the method used to approximate the answer can be refined or optimized. There are competing approaches to answering these questions and methods of combining solvers to obtain more precise answers. The time/precision tradeoff here is real. But these are implementation tradeoffs, and don’t affect the overall design of the language. While there may not be a best solver, there is a best set of syntax and features.</p>

<section id="global-maximum">
<h3>Global maximum<a class="headerlink" href="#global-maximum" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Stroscot aims to be a global maximum of features and syntax, based on the following optimization criteria in order:</p>
<section id="functionality">
<h4>Functionality<a class="headerlink" href="#functionality" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Stroscot is a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-spectrum_language">wide-spectrum language</a>. If the language can’t do X, then people will choose to use another language that can do X. Many languages suffer from “idea envy”, where they try to retrofit new ideas from other languages. For example C++ and Java have recently added lambdas. This retrofitting is due to a shallow intellectual base. No idea is original, and lambdas are quite old. With sufficient research these ideas can be uncovered and incorporated.</p>
<p>Stroscot is based on a survey of the academic literature and uses ideas and techniques mainly from decades ago but also a few published in the past few years. It is actually really hard to come up with better ideas than these papers. I’m not aware of any other programming languages that have tried to do a systematic search through the literature for features; academic languages are narrowly focused and practical languages do not innovate much.</p>
<p>By preferring coverage of all functionality, we ensure a future-proof design, as new ideas are generally small tweaks on old ideas. When a programming language changes significantly, it loses its identity - for example, Python 2 and Python 3 are effectively separate programming languages, as are Perl 5 and Raku (Perl 6). A new language needs new tools and new libraries, so minimizing the number of new languages (breaking changes due to added features) is best.</p>
<p>You may point to INTERCAL’s COMEFROM as something best avoided, but it’s not hard to implement. The trickier parts are actually at the low level, interfacing memory management and calling conventions, and the value proposition there for a powerful interface should be clear. Another theory is that, even if Stroscot fails as a language, implementing lots of features will make people copy Stroscot’s list of features.</p>
</section>
<section id="minimum-set-of-built-in-features">
<h4>Minimum set of built-in features<a class="headerlink" href="#minimum-set-of-built-in-features" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Programming features overlap and solve particular needs, so we need to select a consistent set of features to implement. Fortunately there are only so many ways to implement a given feature. The compiler will provide the smallest set of features that can satisfy all functionality needs in a straightforward manner, trivializing them. E.g. because COMEFROM can be implemented with continuations and macros, we implement continuations and macros, rather than COMEFROM. By selecting the minimum, we ensure the built-in features are a “basis” in the sense that none are redundant. Fewer concepts simplifies the whole language, and approximates Python’s goal of “There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it.” Also it ensures stability - write the compiler once and then go do something else.</p>
</section>
<section id="learnability">
<h4>Learnability<a class="headerlink" href="#learnability" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>It’s often not that easy to learn a language. Google searches will often yield irrelevant results. Official documentation can be useful, but is often filled with terse wording, links to lengthy discussions containing irrelevant detail, and TODOs. The truth can be found in the compiler source code, but this often has one-letter variable names, very few comments, and an assumption that you know the coding style and design of the compiler.</p>
<p>Learnability means making things easier for generations of beginners by making the language “intuitive” so that language choices can be guessed rather than looked up. There is some amount of English discrimination involved, as the learnability studies’ “beginners” are limited to English speakers in Western colleges, but English is the most popular language, and there is the functionality to translate Stroscot to other languages.</p>
<p>Learnability does not necessarily mean making the language similar to existing languages. Such a language might be easier for experts to learn in the short run, but in the long run (assuming Stroscot is successful) there will be many more novices than experts that need to learn the language, so the novices should be prioritized.</p>
</section>
<section id="concision">
<h4>Concision<a class="headerlink" href="#concision" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>If there is a verbose syntax and a terse syntax (as measured by characters or screen space usage), both equally learnable, then the terse syntax is better, because the program can be more cheaply printed out and literate documentation is mainly made up of the prose/code comments rather than code.</p>
<p>APL is sometimes criticized for being too concise, but the actual (learnability) issue with APL is that, like Chinese, it has a lot of symbols and hence novices and experts alike suffer from <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_amnesia">character amnesia</a>. J uses ASCII symbols hence mitigates the issue and is <a class="reference external" href="https://procyonic.org/blog/a-critique-of-the-programming-language-j/">praised for its terseness</a>. But it still is difficult for novices to learn (basically you have to memorize <a class="reference external" href="https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/NuVoc">this page</a>) so an syntax based on English words may be better.</p>
</section>
<section id="performance">
<h4>Performance<a class="headerlink" href="#performance" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Stroscot aims for C-like performance on C-like programs, and similarly to match or exceed the performance of other styles of programming on their compilers. Beyond that, it is hard to make guarantees about the performance of any of the more expressive features. Since the algorithms used are best-in-class, Stroscot will likely give acceptable performance, but some problems are undecidable and the heuristics used may not be sufficient to prevent a combinatorial explosion; such explosions are of course bugs and patches fixing them will be accepted.</p>
<p>In the near term, since there is no compiler or interpreter fully implemented, performance is not measurable and hence is not a consideration. Once the interpreter can pass the tower of interpreters test, that will be the main performance criterion for it. For compilation, besides optimizing the generated code, the main performance-focused feature will be fine-grained incremental compilation to reduce compile times.</p>
<p>“Slow” is relative - if you can do 100x speedups then slow becomes fast and it’s a qualitative difference. Features can’t be gated on performance - implement first, speed up later. A lot of the time programs aren’t written for speed. Most programmers can’t even measure performance correctly - compiled for debug instead of release, etc. Programmers want a convenient language however slow, and for the better programmers a way to speed up their programs when they’re slow (profiling, performance-optimized code). Researchers prefer an inefficient language for which it is easy to devise optimizations and improvements. Similarly programmers don’t want reliable code - they prefer convenience and don’t want to learn new concepts. They will ship when their management says “ship!”</p>

<section id="world-domination">
<h3>World domination<a class="headerlink" href="#world-domination" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Stroscot aims to replace all the programming languages in use today. Mainly this involves improving FFI support and interoperability with C and C++. In particular we need to be able to parse headers and use data from them with Stroscot. Since headers include code we need to be able to fully compile C/C++, so that Stroscot is the sole compiler and all of its global optimizations can be used (<a class="reference external" href="https://andrewkelley.me/post/zig-cc-powerful-drop-in-replacement-gcc-clang.html">zig cc</a> is an example of how this works). The linkage is asymmetric - you can export specific C-style constructs back to C, but C can’t use functions that depend on more advanced features.</p>
<p>Once the C/C++ implementation is stable enough for production use, focus will shift to developing automated conversion tools for other languages like Python and Java, so that the surface syntax can be changed to Stroscot’s. And yes, this is the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">E-E-E strategy</a>, but Stroscot is open source so it’s all OK.</p>
<p>Standardization doesn’t seem necessary, a popular language builds its own standard and Python, the world’s most popular language as of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">July 2022</a>, has <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1535702/python-not-a-standardized-language">never been</a> formally standardized. But there needs to be an open-source cross-platform implementation, with a committee process for changes to build consensus and ensure stability. Another alternative is to freeze Stroscot after release and design a new best language every 3-5 years.</p>

<h2>Other programming languages<a class="headerlink" href="#other-programming-languages" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>There are many existing programming languages to learn from. All of them have had effort put into their design so their features should be considered. Unfortunately there is not enough time to learn every language in depth and use it for 10 years to get an idea of its strengths and weaknesses, so we must rely on reports of other users on the web. Also even searching on the web for detailed reports of complexities encountered in large software projects is quite time-consuming, so we mainly examine popular languages.</p>
<p>Since we aim to be a popular language, we list the languages in order of popularity, so that more attention is focused on the earlier languages. There are several indexes with different measures of popularity (as of January 2023):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE</a> measures the quantity of search engine hits for “X programming”</p></li>

<p>Out of these the PYPL index is probably most suited for designing a new language, because the tutorial measurement approximates the new PLs with features that programmers want.
