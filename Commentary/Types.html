<h1>Types<a class="headerlink" href="#types" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Stroscot has sets and assertions about whether values are in sets. But are sets types? Is Stroscot typed? These get down to the semantics of type systems. Unfortunately these terms are ambiguous in the literature.  This is an attempt to exhaustively answer the question by considering each definition.</p>
<section id="what-is-a-type">
<h2>What is a type?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-type" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Parnas, Shore &amp; Weiss 1976 identified various definitions of a “type”:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Syntactic</dt><dd><p>A type is a purely syntactic label</p>
</dd>
<dt>Representation</dt><dd><p>A type is defined in terms of a composition of machine types.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Value space</dt><dd><p>A type is a set of possible values</p>
</dd>
<dt>And behavior</dt><dd><p>One of the above plus a set of operators or functions that can be applied to the type</p>
</dd>
<dt>Their definition</dt><dd><p>A mode is a property of a variable that defines data representation and access. Any value that can be stored in one variable of a given mode can be stored in another variable of the same mode. A type is a set of modes.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Academics seem to have gravitated to the syntactic definition because it’s easier to publish meaningless gibberish. Similarly Haskell, Java, and C++ use a syntactic definition AFAICT. I don’t think there are many languages that use representation as this would imply that all pairs of floats are the same type.</p>
<p>Stroscot follows Julia in using the “value space without behavior” definition. Castagna calls them “set-theoretic types with semantic subtyping”. A related approach is <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="../zzreferences.html#id39" title="Stephen Dolan. Algebraic Subtyping. PhD thesis, University of Cambridge, September 2016. URL: https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/stephen-dolan/thesis.pdf.">Dol16</a>]</span>, which uses syntactic labels forming a distributive lattice. Although distributive lattices are isomorphic to collections of sets, Dolan’s approach IMO falls on the syntactic side.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://wphomes.soic.indiana.edu/jsiek/what-is-gradual-typing/">This post</a> says “a [gradual] type is something that describes a set of values that have a bunch of operations in common”, i.e. value space plus behavior. Stroscot’s sets don’t have behavior so are not gradual types.</p>
<p>Overall, while I would be justified in calling Stroscot’s sets types, it’s not perfectly consistent with the common usage today so it could invite a flamewar. It’s easier to call them sets.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-a-type-system">
<h2>What is a type system?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-type-system" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Wikipedia defines a type system as “a set of rules that assigns a property called a type to the various constructs of a computer program”. This phrasing assumes each construct has exactly one “principal” type. But more complex type systems don’t have this property. For example with a Haskell GADT <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">data</span> <span class="pre">R</span> <span class="pre">where</span> <span class="pre">R</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">{</span> <span class="pre">unR</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">Int</span> <span class="pre">}</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">R</span> <span class="pre">Int</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unR</span></code> may have the type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">forall</span> <span class="pre">a.</span> <span class="pre">R</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">a</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">forall</span> <span class="pre">a.</span> <span class="pre">R</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Int</span></code>, and these have no unifying type. Haskell just picks a type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unR</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">R</span> <span class="pre">Int</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Int</span></code> in this case. Really the mapping from expressions to types is many-to-many.</p>
<p>Per <a class="reference external" href="https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/dynamic-languages-are-static-languages/">Robert Harper</a> the main point of a type system is to allow “stating and enforcing the invariant that the value at a particular program point must be a certain type” (e.g. an integer), in the form of a type declarations. Particularly this is to optimize inter-modular calls, so that the ABI is efficient.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Stroscot’s set membership assertions express these type declaration invariants and give the execution efficiency and safety of a “statically typed, compiled language”.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Cliff Click’s even broader definition is “something that allows catching errors quickly at compile time”, where example errors are calling a non-function or applying a primitive operation to the wrong type. Stroscot’s static verification is more powerful than unit testing or type systems, and can catch hard bugs quickly and prove the absence of classes of bugs, allowing rapid development of quality software. The main interface is expresssing invariants as assertions, but type annotations can also be expressed as invariants.</p>
<p>As far as the amount of type declarations, the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_one_infinity_rule">Zero one infinity rule</a> applies. A program should run without any type declarations, with one declaration for the root of the program, or with any amount of type declarations scattered through the program. The no type declarations is an “untyped” setting and ensures there is a complete operational semantics distinct from the type system. The one type declaration enables checking the program for bad behavior, and ruling out common errors such as typos. The infinite declarations allows using the power of static verification to its fullest, and may require many iterations of tweaked declarations to get right.</p>
<p>Assertions are IMO more natural in many cases than types since they have an operational semantics, e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">divide</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">b</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">assert</span> <span class="pre">(b</span> <span class="pre">!=</span> <span class="pre">0);</span> <span class="pre">...</span></code> rather than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">divide</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">Int</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Int\{0}</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Int</span></code>. Although, higher-order types can be somewhat more succinct than writing out logical set membership assertions by hand, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">f</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">(Int</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Int)</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Int</span></code> vs <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{</span> <span class="pre">s</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">arbElem;</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">arbElem;</span> <span class="pre">assume(a</span> <span class="pre">isElemOf</span> <span class="pre">Int);</span> <span class="pre">assume(s</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">isElemOf</span> <span class="pre">Int);</span> <span class="pre">assert(f</span> <span class="pre">s</span> <span class="pre">isElemOf</span> <span class="pre">Int)</span> <span class="pre">}</span></code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="type-inference">
<h2>Type inference<a class="headerlink" href="#type-inference" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Type inference is often used with the idea that its failure means there is a type error in the program. But static verification finds those errors already and distinguishes between real errors and algorithm failures, whereas type inference failure could be either.</p>
<p>Type inference means many signatures can be omitted, like unityping with implicitly assigning the universal type. But type-inference algorithms are complex- they can fail, and even if they succeed their results are not obvious to humans. Unityping means the semantics doesn’t depend on types at all, meaning one less thing to think about, hence making programming easier. Type inference allows writing some programs without thinking about types, but there is always the chance the program is untypeable - and there are many examples of untypeable programs, e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\z.</span> <span class="pre">(z</span> <span class="pre">1,</span> <span class="pre">z</span> <span class="pre">&quot;x&quot;)</span></code> for H-M. Cliff Click’s system can type this but fails on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cliffclick/aa/issues/28">a more complex program</a> that runs fine in a unityped system. The errors on these untypeable programs will always be verbose (because of the inferred type) and confusing (because the programmer was not thinking about the inference algorithm).</p>
<p>Types can used to describe the ABI, <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="../zzreferences.html#id78">JB09</a>]</span> hence type inference is a form of ABI selection. But the ABI selection is based on performance. Furthermore the ABI types can be conditioned on state, and there is a fallback catch-all format for hard cases. So overall ABI selection uses a separate notion of type based on representation, with no principality requirement like for normal type inference.</p>
<p>At the REPL systems such Haskell provide a command to display the inferred type of an expression, and similarly Haddock can show pretty-printed inferred type signatures. But this doesn’t extend well to complex type systems:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span id="id3">[<a class="reference internal" href="../zzreferences.html#id107" title="Mayur Naik and Jens Palsberg. A type system equivalent to a model checker. ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, 30(5):1–24, August 2008. URL: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1387673.1387678 (visited on 2021-07-15), doi:10.1145/1387673.1387678.">NP08</a>]</span> provides a method to interpret the model produced by a model checker as a type derivation using flow, intersection, and union types. Stroscot could similarly be written to output Church-style types reflecting the properties it verifies for every expression. But the types would be complex and precise, e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">length</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">(Nil--&gt;0)</span> <span class="pre">&amp;</span> <span class="pre">(Cons</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">b--&gt;1+(length</span> <span class="pre">b))</span></code>, hence hard to interpret.</p></li>
<li><p>With subtyping the principal type would presumably be the minimal type containing the value, which is not very informative. E.g. instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">Int</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">Nat</span></code> the inferred type would just be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">{1}</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>It is of high complexity to infer <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/UlfNorell/insane/">dependent</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gelisam/circular-sig">circular</a> types</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe these issues can be solved by heuristics for inferring types. But it seems that we can solve it more easily:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>REPL inferred types can be replaced by smarter value printing, e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:show</span> <span class="pre">id</span></code> gives <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Prelude.id</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">\x</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">x</span></code>, or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:show</span> <span class="pre">[1..100]</span></code> gives <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">100</span> <span class="pre">integers</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation can simply show the list of developer-defined type signatures (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:t</span> <span class="pre">(+)</span></code> giving <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Int</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Int</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Int</span></code> and the other overloadings). Haddock has been able to use GHC’s inferred type signatures <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/haskell/haddock/commit/d300632cbc2346f6d95188426e5db5fbeb7c9f34">since 2008</a>, but it still encourages explicit type signatures.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So overall it seems type inference is not necessary with the correct design.</p>

<section id="soundness-and-completeness">
<h2>Soundness and completeness<a class="headerlink" href="#soundness-and-completeness" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Type soundness means “type preservation”, i.e. if <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">T</span></code> then evaluating <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span></code> must produce a value in the type’s domain <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">〚T〛</span></code> in every denotational semantics. A sound type system rejects incorrect programs by pointing out their type  with a diagnostic. An example of an unsound type system feature is Java’s covariant arrays. The program <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">String[]</span> <span class="pre">strs</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">{</span> <span class="pre">&quot;a&quot;</span> <span class="pre">};Object[]</span> <span class="pre">objs</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">strs;objs[0]</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">1;String</span> <span class="pre">one</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">strs[0];</span></code> typechecks but produces an ArrayStoreException at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">objs[0]</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code>. Soundness is qualified to a subset of programs S of a language L. If L is unsound but L/S is sound we say L is sound up to S. Java is sound up to covariant arrays, null pointers, and a few other warts. TypeScript is sound up to first class functions and downcasts from the any type. Most type systems are also unsound with respect to nontermination - an infinite loop is of any type but does not produce a value of that type (modeling nontermination as evaluating to ⊥). Type systems sound with respect to nontermination, such as System F, are called “total”.</p>
<p>An unsound type system does not prove anything about its programs, so a compiler has to assume the worst and compile with a unityped semantics. Fortunately most “unsound” type systems can be made sound by extending the domains of types to include the missing values. E.g. Haskell is not total but can be made sound with respect to nontermination by including ⊥ in the domain of every type as well as partially defined values like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(⊥,2)</span></code>.</p>
<p>Type completeness is a more vague notion; the common definition is that “all correct programs are accepted, given sufficient type annotations”. Java’s unsound null pointers allows it to accept some uses of null pointers that would be ruled out with a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Nullable&lt;T&gt;</span></code> type, making it complete relative to null pointers.</p>
<p>There is also soundness and completeness in logic, which is different:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A theory is logically sound (valid) if all of its theorems are tautologies, i.e. every formula that can be proved in the system is valid in every semantic interpretation of the language of the system.</p></li>
<li><p>A theory is logically satisfiable if it has a model, i.e., there exists an interpretation in ZFC under which all provable formulas in the theory are true.</p></li>
<li><p>A theory is semantically complete when all its tautologies are theorems, i.e. every formula that is true under every interpretation of the language of the system can be proven using the rules of the system.</p></li>
<li><p>A theory is syntactically complete if, for each formula φ of the language of the system, either φ or ¬φ is a theorem. Alternately, for all unprovable sentences φ, φ ⊢ ⊥ is a theorem.</p></li>
<li><p>A theory is logically consistent if there is no formula φ such that both φ and its negation ¬φ are provable.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Via the Curry-Howard correspondence we can interpret formulas as types and provability of a formula as a program term of that type existing. We restrict to the semantic interpretation that maps formulas/types to sets and evaluate terms to values in those sets. So then:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A TS is logically sound/valid if every inhabited type T in the semantic interpretation of the language has a  nonempty type domain 〚T〛.</p></li>
<li><p>A TS is logically satisfiable if a semantics exists where all of its inhabited types have elements in their type domains.</p></li>
<li><p>A TS is semantically complete when all nonempty type domains 〚T〛 have program terms of type T (T inhabited).</p></li>
<li><p>A TS is syntactically complete if, for each type T, either T or ¬T is inhabited. Alternately, for all empty types T, there is a program of type T -&gt; Void.</p></li>
<li><p>A TS is logically consistent if there is no type T such that both T and ¬T are inhabited.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Semantic completeness and logical soundness only care about types being inhabited and hence are weaker than type completeness/soundness which care about all specific programs.</p>
<p>Java does not have a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Void</span></code> type (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">void</span></code> is a unit type), but if it did it would most likely be logically inconsistent because a nonterminating program could inhabit the function type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Void</span></code>. In general most type systems are logically inconsistent because a nonterminating loop inhabits all function types. However since all non-Void types are inhabited Java is syntactically complete. Furthermore we can likely formalize the execution model of Java and obtain that Java is logically satisfiable, logically sound, and semantically complete.</p>
<p>So the difficult property to ensure is logical consistency. By Godel’s first incompleteness theorem there are no consistent, syntactically complete systems with inference rules of complexity at most <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta_{1}^{0}\)</span> that contain integer arithmetic. For example System F is consistent and of complexity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Sigma_1^0 &gt; \Delta_{1}^{0}\)</span> but still is incomplete and <a class="reference external" href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/48884/are-there-strongly-normalizing-lambda-terms-that-cannot-be-given-a-system-f-type">cannot type some strongly normalizing terms</a>. Intersection type systems extended with negation are complete but inconsistent due to ω. However they are consistent when extended with a complexity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Sigma_1^0\)</span> oracle that computes principal types such that the type contains ω iff the term is not strongly normalizing. <span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="../zzreferences.html#id57" title="Silvia Ghilezan. Strong Normalization and Typability with Intersection Types. Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic, 37(1):44–52, January 1996.

<p>The simplest complete and consistent system is the unitype system. This consists of a universe type whose domain contains all values and its negation the empty type. To ensure consistency we must ensure that the empty type is uninhabited, so all programs must be of the universe type. This means nonterminating programs must have a value in the semantic domain. If we add termination checking we can put nonterminating programs in the empty type and restrict the universe to terminating programs, but this increases the complexity.</p>

<h2>Unityped<a class="headerlink" href="#unityped" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Per <a class="reference external" href="https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/dynamic-languages-are-static-languages/">Robert Harper</a> all type systems are static. So this is really about dynamic vs not. Harper has coined the phrase “unityped” to describe what is commonly known as a dynamic language. In Stroscot this word is short for “universally typed”, i.e. the language has a universal type that can contain all values. This definition is slightly different from Harper’s, who uses “unitype” to mean that there is only one type in the language. We will call Harper’s definition “single-typed”. If a language is single-typed it must be unityped, since all values are in the single universal type, but not every uni-typed language is single-typed.</p>
<p>Consider the notion of Curry-style types, called sorts in <span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="../zzreferences.html#id116" title="Frank Pfenning. Church and Curry: combining intrinsic and extrinsic typing. In Christoph Benzmüller, Chad E. Brown, Jörg Siekmann, and Richard Statman, editors, Reasoning in Simple Type Theory: Festschrift in Honour of Peter B. Andrews on His 70th Birthday, volume 17 of Studies in Logic: Mathematical Logic and Foundations, pages 288–323. College Publications, London, December 2008. URL: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/papers/andrews08.pdf.">Pfe08</a>]</span>. Sorts define properties that can be checked or ignored, extrinsic to the terms themselves. A term may satisfy several sorts, or none at all. Since the sorts are optional there must necessarily be an operational semantics that does not refer to any sorts, and hence the language is unityped if it has a trivial sort that checks no properties. Even if the language is unityped, it doesn’t have to be single-typed, because there can still be more than one type (sort) - in fact there can be a whole language of properties/sorts.</p>
<p>A unityped language means if you write zero type signatures and ignore all type warnings the program still compiles and runs and produces a value. The compiler starts with the universal sort and refines this as much as it can, but even if it fails there is still an operational semantics.</p>
<p>Non-unityped programs are a subset of unityped programs. Every non-unityped program has a corresponding unityped program where the values are extended to contain the type information as a tag (reification). Often the operational semantics does not depend on the type and we can simply erase the type. In the specific case of return type overloaded type classes, where type inference is key, the semantics can be made nondeterministic and type annotations can be incorporated explicitly as pruning possibilities.</p>
<p>Non-unityped is at most as expressive - there are programs which unityped allows which most non-unityped systems reject. Haskell has a <a class="reference external" href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.16.1.0/docs/Data-Dynamic.html">Dynamic type</a> which allows expressing such programs. It seems to only be a GHC limitation that it can only contain monomorphic values. Clean’s dynamic can store polymorphic types and presumably one could add polymorphic <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Typeable</span></code> instances to GHC as well. But even though Dynamic can store all values it is not a universal type because <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">Int</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">toDyn</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">Dynamic</span></code> are distinct values. So unityping also requires subtyping.</p>
<p>It complicates the language unnecessarily to have two values which can’t be stored to the same variable or type tests which can’t scrutinize some values.</p>
<p>Overall unityping seems good, hence Stroscot is unityped.</p>

<h2>Static vs dynamic<a class="headerlink" href="#static-vs-dynamic" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>“Soft typing” is similar to the verification approach, but uses failure of type inference instead of model checking. This means it cannot prove that it actually found an error, and it must stay within the boundaries of type systems, an open research problem. The verification approach is well-explored and its algorithm produces three types of outcomes: hard errors, passing programs, or verification algorithm failure. Similar to Haskell’s “deferred type errors” flag, hard errors can still be ignored, but they will trigger an error at runtime. Similar to soft type checking, verification algorithm failure can be ignored - these may or may not trigger an error.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Principle: Good type systems must balance permissiveness with strictness.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Type systems must allow valid programs and catch errors.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Principle: Even sound static type systems compromise on some “type-like” errors and check them dynamically.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Consider the hd function in ML. The type of this function is ‘a list -&gt; ‘a. However, clearly, when applied to the nil list, which is a well-typed application, hd cannot return a useful value. One could imagine some type system in which lists are further subdivided into empty and non-empty static types. ML does not take this approach. Instead, it checks dynamically and raises an exception.</p>
<p>In practice, in order to be useful, all statically typed languages compromise and define some “type-like” errors as dynamic errors. The other classic example is an array-out-of-bounds error: one can imagine a language in which all arrays have statically known size. In such a language there would be no such thing as a generic array of integers; instead, there would be an array of integers of length 1, an array of integers of length 2, etc. One would then be able to check statically that all array accesses were in bounds.</p>
<p>The drawback of such a system is that it would not be possible to write functions over arrays of unknown size. This is not considered acceptable for most practical programming. Indeed, the original version of the Pascal language had array types that fixed the size — it was not possible to write routines that were polymorphic over array size — and this was one of the reasons that programmers rejected this language.</p>
<p>In practice, most type-safe languages allow array size polymorphism, and check array bounds dynamically.</p>
<p>Practically one cannot encode Harper’s “unitype” scheme in existing static languages such as ML, because ML’s type system is incomplete and hence some dynamic terms are untypable. Further datatypes in ML require pattern matching to extract the value, endless tedium. A dynamic language provides easy syntax.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>multiple forms of complex numbers</dt><dd><p>rectangular: 1+2 i
polar: sqrt(5) e^(i arctan(2))</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>They are mostly interchangeable, a 1-1 conversion between polar and rectangular. But in practice not, e.g. 0 has only one rectangular form but many polar forms, and the polar angle can differ by any multiple of 360 degrees. Restricting the domain to theta in [0,360 degrees) and r=0 -&gt; theta=0 fixes this.</p>
<p>Some forms are more convenient for some computations. A given computation may require and return results in a specific form. We may overload computations work on both forms, testing which form is given and dispatching to the appropriate sub-computation. Data structures such as sets can contain any form and also other types of values. So there are several sets relevant to programming with complex numbers:
* the set of all rectangular forms
* the set of all polar forms
* the disjoint union of the above (sum type)
* the universal set containing the above and all other values</p>
<p>even if a particular value is an integer, it is a value of universal set.
how do you represent, check, remove, and apply the tag on the value each time it is used?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Consider:</p>
<p>x = 4 : int
y = x : nat</p>
<p>We’re assigning supertype to subtype here (nat &lt;: int), which could potentially fail. But we can be sure from inspection that it will succeed.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>when you prove properties of your program, you end up finding bugs, almost regardless of what properties you are trying to prove.</p>
<p>If complex numbers are classified as either rectangular or polar, then if you see:
f : Complex -&gt; …
You know the argument is one of polar or rectangular, although which one is not known until runtime. You have ruled out all other values. With a unityped language you cannot express this restriction.</p>
<p>Sufficiently fancy types can give enough information to write ‘obvious’ pieces of code automatically, and with proof assistants this can be a dialogue. An elementary example of this is Lennart Augustsson’s djinn, which will take types like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fmap</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">(a</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">b)</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Maybe</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Maybe</span> <span class="pre">b</span></code>  or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">callCC</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">((a</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Cont</span> <span class="pre">r</span> <span class="pre">b)</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Cont</span> <span class="pre">r</span> <span class="pre">a)</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Cont</span> <span class="pre">r</span> <span class="pre">a</span></code> and write code that has the type. These can be non-trivial to write if you’re just thinking about how it should behave, but the type completely determines the implementation.</p>
