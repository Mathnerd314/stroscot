<h1>Memory management<a class="headerlink" href="#memory-management" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Per <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="../zzreferences.html#id88" title="Jeehoon Kang, Chung-Kil Hur, William Mansky, Dmitri Garbuzov, Steve Zdancewic, and Viktor Vafeiadis. A formal C memory model supporting integer-pointer casts. In Proceedings of the 36th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation, 326–335. Portland OR USA, June 2015. ACM. URL: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2737924.2738005 (visited on 2021-06-14), doi:10.1145/2737924.2738005.">KHM+15</a>]</span> there are pretty much two models of memory. The “concrete” model models memory as a an integer-indexed array of 2^32 or 2^64 words, or more generally the model exposed by the OS. The “symbolic” model models memory as an associative array from symbols (potentially infinite in number) to “cells”, arrays of values (stored in some unspecified format). Semantically, these models give you pointers and references respectively. Kang describes how combinations of these can be made, for example the “quasi-concrete model” which uses a data type that starts out containing a reference, implements various arithmetic operations symbolically, but switches to a pointer once an integer address is requested, but the concrete and symbolic models are the fundamental ideas.</p>
<section id="symbolic-memory">
<h2>Symbolic memory<a class="headerlink" href="#symbolic-memory" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>A reference is a symbolic index into a global associative array of objects, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Map</span> <span class="pre">Reference</span> <span class="pre">Object</span></code>. The array allows allocating new references, deleting them, and reading/writing the reference. Reference symbols can be compared for equality, hashed to an integer, packed to a 64-bit word that’s in pointer format, and unpacked to the identical reference. The value when converted reference is internal to the memory system but doesn’t change.</p>
<p>There are higher-level types like immutable references and reference wrappers, but those all translate away to normal references or pointer access and don’t need involvement from the compiler.</p>
<section id="pointer-conversion">
<h3>Pointer conversion<a class="headerlink" href="#pointer-conversion" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The in-memory location of the data of a reference is not fixed. If it’s small enough it could just be in a register, or there could be multiple copies of the data. Also GC can move/copy the reference.</p>
<p>Often operations require a pointer to a memory address, so you can pin the object to a pointer (“materialize” it in memory), <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(address,</span> <span class="pre">unpinner)</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">getPointer</span> <span class="pre">ref</span></code>. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unpinner</span></code> is a finalizer that unpins the object after you are finished with the pointer. The alignment of the pointer can be specified during the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">getPointer</span></code> operation.. The default is no alignment, to allow packing data compactly, although of course the location may be aligned anyway.</p>
<p>Internally, when compiling away the symbolic memory model, the compiler tries to find a good place to store the data - if it’s lucky, it can backpropagate the pointer request and store it there from the beginning, so that no copies are needed. When the data cannot be associated with a fixed address like that, it is stored in a special memory allocation area that is configured to trap on stray program-level access.</p>
</section>
<section id="representation">
<h3>Representation<a class="headerlink" href="#representation" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>A lot of languages have a fixed or default memory representation for values, e.g. a C struct, a Haskell ADT, and a Python object are always laid out in pretty much the same way. The more systems-level languages allow controlling the layout with flags, for example Rust has <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html">type layout</a> which allows specifying the size and alignment/padding of its fields, and also C compatibility. But these flags are’t really that powerful. Here’s some examples of what can’t be done:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>specify the in-memory order of fields differently from their logical order</p></li>
<li><p>turn array-of-structs into struct-of-arrays</p></li>
<li><p>flattening a datatype, like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Either</span> <span class="pre">Bool</span> <span class="pre">Int</span></code> into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(Bool,Int)</span></code>, or representing a linked list as a contiguous series of records.</p></li>
<li><p>NaN-boxing and NuN-boxing (<a class="reference external" href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2011/05/18/value-representation-in-javascript-implementations">ref</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/js/public/Value.h#526">2</a>), representing the JS <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Any</span></code> type as a single 64-bit word.</p></li>
<li><p>parsing network packets into structured data</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe some of these could be addressed by flags, but from the last two, it is clear that we are really looking for a general-purpose memory serialization interface. I looked at <a class="reference external" href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/binary-0.8.9.1/docs/src/Data.Binary.Get.Internal.html#Decoder">Data.Binary</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/store-core-0.4.4.4/docs/Data-Store-Core.html">store</a>, and <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="../zzreferences.html#id40" title="Benjamin Delaware, Sorawit Suriyakarn, Clément Pit-Claudel, Qianchuan Ye, and Adam Chlipala. Narcissus: correct-by-construction derivation of decoders and encoders from binary formats. Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages, 3(ICFP):1–29, July 2019. URL: https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bendy/Narcissus/narcissus.pdf (visited on 2020-07-26), doi:10.1145/3341686.">DSPitClaudel+19</a>]</span> and came up with the most general API I could, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Write</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">Alloc</span> <span class="pre">(Size,Align)</span> <span class="pre">(Addr</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Write)</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">Store,</span> <span class="pre">Store</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">Map</span> <span class="pre">Addr</span> <span class="pre">MaskedWord</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Unpack</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">Maybe</span> <span class="pre">Addr</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Read</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">a,</span> <span class="pre">Read</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">Map</span> <span class="pre">Addr</span> <span class="pre">Word</span></code>. This allows masked writes and multiple or fixed allocation addresses, but does not allow failing to read the value back. Also the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pack</span></code> function allows passing arbitrary side-band data to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unpack</span></code> function.</p>
<p>Maybe though, it is still not general enough, we should just have lens-like functions like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">write</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">Memory</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Memory</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">read</span> <span class="pre">::</span> <span class="pre">Memory</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">a</span></code>. There still need to be constraints though, like that you get back what you wrote and non-interference of writes.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="pointers">
<h2>Pointers<a class="headerlink" href="#pointers" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Pointers are the low-level API, they can interface with the OS or other languages (mainly C). I did a study of memory APIs and concluded that memory can be modeled as a global mutable array, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Memory</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">Map</span> <span class="pre">(Word,BitIdx)</span> <span class="pre">Status</span></code>. The status allows storing metadata, it’s <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Mathnerd314/stroscot/blob/master/src/model/MemoryStatus.hs">a complex ADT</a> which has various states like unallocated, committed, etc. The array is indexed at the bit level because that’s the granularity <a class="reference external" href="https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/mc-manual.html#mc-manual.machine">Valgrind’s Memcheck</a> uses, but most of the status will be the same for a byte or page as the memory allocators / OS operations work at higher granularity.</p>
<p>Memory functions check the status of memory before operating, hence identifying common errors like double free, access to undefined memory, null pointer dereferencing, etc. Similarly unused memory cannot be read/written, preventing use after free. But there is still the possibility of overflowing a buffer into an adjacent allocation, or more generally <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_punning">type punning</a> by reading some memory as a format it was not written with. These sorts of possibilities are intrinsic to the “big array of bits” model, and many low-level hacks rely on such functionality, so forbidding such possibilities entirely is not an option. But of course someone can easily add bounds-checking etc. on top of the basic model as a library.</p>
<p>Most addresses will not be allocated (status Free), hence the array is sparse in some sense. It is in fact possible to implement the typical <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/SparseArray">sparse array operations</a>. There are functions to directly allocate memory at an address. Reading and writing are done directly in assembly. The list of currently mapped pages can be had from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/proc/self/maps</span></code> and <a class="reference external" href="https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/8297/proc-self-maps-equivalent-on-windows/8299">VirtualQueryEx</a>, although this has to be filtered to remove pages reserved by the kernel and internal pages allocated by the runtime, and looks slow - it’s easier to wrap the allocation functions and maintain a separate list of user-level allocations. Clearing mappings, hashing memory, and indexing by mapped pages all work when restricted to the list of user pages. It’s a little more complicated than simple sparsity because there are many different statuses and the operations overlap.</p>
<p>In practice fixed-address allocation is never used and instead there are <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mmap</span> <span class="pre">NULL</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">malloc</span></code>, and the C library API alloc/realloc/free which allocate memory with system-chosen / allocator-chosen location. The right model for this is adversarial, i.e. the allocator chooses the worst possible location. Then to ensure correct program behavior, it should not matter what addresses the system picks, i.e. all choices should be observationally equivalent. The limitations on the system’s choice are that the allocation must be suitably aligned and disjoint from all unrevoked allocations. (The system can also return an out of memory error, but this doesn’t have to result in equivalent behavior so it can be ignored.)</p>
<section id="optimizing-access">
<h3>Optimizing access<a class="headerlink" href="#optimizing-access" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Eliminating pointer reads amounts to tracking down the matching pointer write, which can be accomplished by tracing control flow. Eliminating pointer writes requires proving that the address is never read before deallocation, which requires a global analysis of pointer reads. They’re both a bit tricky as they have to make assumptions about what pointers foreign code will use and analyze the possible values a dereference may take. But, should be possible.</p>

<section id="finalizers">
<span id="id3"></span><h2>Finalizers<a class="headerlink" href="#finalizers" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Finalizers allow the prompt freeing of allocated memory and resources like thread handles, file handles, and sockets, by implicitly inserting the free operation in the locations.</p>
<p>A finalizer is a magic value created with the one-argument function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">newFinalizer</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">(free</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">Command)</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Op</span> <span class="pre">Finalizer</span></code>. It supports equality, hashing, and command <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">use</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">Finalizer</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Command</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">useForever</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">Finalizer</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Op</span> <span class="pre">Command</span></code>. The semantics is that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">free</span></code> will be called as soon as it is known that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">use</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">useForever</span></code> will not be called. Calling <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">use</span></code> delays finalization until after the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">use</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">useForever</span></code> cancels the finalizer and returns the free operation. The general transformation:</p>

<h3>Freed on exit<a class="headerlink" href="#freed-on-exit" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Many resources are automatically freed by the OS on exit: memory, file handles, etc. In this circumstance  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">useForever</span></code> can mark the resource as not needing finalization. As an optimization you can call it on every allocated resource once you are on the termination path and know that no further resources will be allocated, or that there are sufficient spare resources that any further allocation can be satisfied without deallocation. But prompt deallocation is the better policy.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="unsafe">
<h2>Unsafe<a class="headerlink" href="#unsafe" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Rust locks all its memory APIs behind the “unsafe” keyword, as if using the underlying computer hardware is inherently unsafe. It’s only certain tasks that are unsafe. And with the proper API for low-level systems programming, those tasks can be statically checked. These sorts of memory APIs are necessary for writing your own operating system or memory allocator. “unsafe” is an anti-pattern - either a feature is useful or it isn’t, and if it isn’t useful then don’t provide it. Nanny-state “yes I really want to do this” prompts are just a waste of everyone’s time.</p>
</section>
<section id="location-vs-allocation">
<h2>Location vs allocation<a class="headerlink" href="#location-vs-allocation" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Memory management is usually presented as two operations, allocation and deallocation/freeing. But really the array-of-bits model is more accurate. The costs of allocation/deallocation are hard to predict, as all they do is update metadata. With a suitable OS/allocator design, they most likely will be pretty cheap. For example <a class="reference external" href="https://www.forrestthewoods.com/blog/benchmarking-malloc-with-doom3/">in Doom 3</a> the median time for is 31 nanoseconds, ranging from 21 nanoseconds to 201 microseconds, and free is comparable. Generally, if they are a bottleneck, the operations can be combined into a single larger operation (allocate a larger buffer, call <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">close_range</span></code> to close several open FD’s than to iterate over them individually) by pushing allocations forward and delaying frees, as long as there is sufficient memory or resource capacity available. In contrast, reads and writes are always real work. Filling a page with random data and reading it back will be at most a few GB/s, and most likely in the 300 MB/s range.</p>
<p>Obviously, speeding up allocation is still important, but it is more important to pay attention to cache effects from the choice of address. In the trivial case, the memory usage can be predicted in advance and allocations given fixed assignments, giving zero cost memory allocation. In more practical applications, variable allocations will need to be tracked, but it is still not an expensive problem, and there are well-known algorithms.</p>
</section>
<section id="memory-errors">
<h2>Memory errors<a class="headerlink" href="#memory-errors" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Per Wikipedia there are a few types of memory errors:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Memory leak: now-unused memory is not freed</p></li>
<li><p>Use-after-free: attempt to use freed memory</p></li>
<li><p>Double free: attempt to free freed memory</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Inspired by ASAP, we can solve all these errors by inserting frees automatically. In particular, as defined in the semantics of finalizers, we insert a free for a piece of memory promptly after the last access. This avoids all the above errors. Such an analysis is more precise than traditional GC, because GC looks at what references are “in scope” and cannot free an unused subpart of a structure. But semantics-wise, memory management is a static, completely solvable problem. It is just of a high complexity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Sigma^0_1\)</span>. So if we are willing to accept potentially long compile times, we can eliminate memory errors.</p>
<p>There are also “space leaks” where memory could be freed earlier by evaluating expressions in a specific order but some other order is chosen. Certainly there is some evaluation order that results in minimum RAM usage, but maybe a less compact order is more time-efficient. So there is some amount of time-space tradeoff for this category.</p>
<p>The path from cloud to CPU is long, so there is a lot of caching in between. Some latency numbers and the programming API:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Physical registers (0.3 ns): managed by the CPU</p></li>
<li><p>Logical registers (0.3 ns): assembly read/write</p></li>
<li><p>Memory Ordering Buffers (MOB), L1/L2/L3 Cache (0.5-7 ns): Managed by the CPU</p></li>
<li><p>Main Memory (0.1us-4us): assembly read/write</p></li>
<li><p>GPU memory (0.2us-0.5us): assembly read/write, driver ioctl’s</p></li>
<li><p>SSD (16us-62us): kernel file APIs</p></li>
<li><p>LAN (0.5-500ms): kernel network stack, driver bypass</p></li>
<li><p>HDD (3 ms): kernel file APIs</p></li>
<li><p>WAN (150ms): kernel network stack, driver bypass</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Not all applications will use all of these, but all will use some and there is an application that uses each. So all of these have to be modeled in order to create a performant application. The memory management system combines all of these into a single “storage” abstraction and moves data between locations as appropriate.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A loop that allocates and deallocates a scratch buffer in the body is much more performant if the buffer is allocated to the same location every time - the allocation/deallocation code can even be pulled out of the loop.</p></li>
<li><p>Grouping hot variables into a page, so the page is always loaded and ready</p></li>
<li><p>Grouping things that will be freed together (pools/arenas)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ownership a la Rust cannot even handle doubly-linked lists so is not worth considering. Code frequently switches to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Rc</span></code> reference counted type, which besides cycles has the semantics of GC. There is even a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Others/shredder">library</a> for a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Gc</span></code> type that does intrusive scanning. GC is more composable and it can also be faster than manual memory management <span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="../zzreferences.html#id9" title="Andrew W. Appel. Garbage collection can be faster than stack allocation. Information Processing Letters, 25(4):275–279, June 1987. URL: https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/45.pdf (visited on 2020-07-24), doi:10.1016/0020-0190(87)90175-X.">App87</a>]</span>. As Appel points out, even if freeing an individual object is a single machine instruction, such as a stack pop, freeing a lot of objects still has significant overhead compared to copying out the useful data. But garbage collection scanning slows things down because it pulls in a lot of memory; generational GC reduces this somewhat, but the more interesting area of memory management research is static analysis. To that end some work <span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="../zzreferences.html#id130" title="Raphaël L Proust. ASAP: As Static As Possible memory management.

Conceptually we are taking a tracing GC algorithm and replacing the tracing with a compile time analysis that outputs a comparatively small bit of runtime checks. It’s whole program and undecidable, but Stroscot already has 3 or 4 of those planned.</p>
<p>Why hasn’t anyone done static memory management before? Well, the notion of termination analysis only got started in 2007 or so. 10 years later Proust applies the techniques to memory, it’s slow but there is a conceptual leap in going from program verification to program synthesis. It could have happened faster but I can see why it didn’t.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The newly-dead set for a state transition <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">s</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">t</span></code> is all objects that are accessed before but not accessed later, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">{z</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">Access(s,z)</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">yes</span> <span class="pre">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="pre">Access(t,z)</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">no}</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">L(s)</span> <span class="pre">intersect</span> <span class="pre">D(t)</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We deallocate the newly-dead set after each operation. This doesn’t necessarily reclaim the memory, but ensures freeing is timely if needed. We also can compact the live set by removing dead fields.</p>
<p>Quad-color marking</p>
<p>The GC status of an object is set by two bits, the mark bit and the gray bit. The mark bit is stored in a bitmap, can be white or black. The gray bit is stored in a boxed_value object, determining whether an object has been fully marked. Only traversable objects have a gray bit and hence quad colors. Non-traversable (leaf) objects have very simple state transitions (just white-&gt;black-&gt;white).</p>

<p>local (“arena”) allocators speed up short-running programs, keep long–running ones from slowing down over time. All global allocators eventually exhibit diffusion–i.e., memory initially dispensed and therefore (coincidentally) accessed contiguously, over time, ceases to remain so, hence runtime performance invariably degrades. This form of degradation has little to do with the runtime performance of the allocator used, but rather is endemic to the program itself as well as the underlying computer platform, which invariably thrives on locality of reference.”
diffusion should not be confused with fragmentation–an entirely different phenomenon pertaining solely to (“coalescing”) allocators (not covered in this paper) where initially large chunks of contiguous memory decay into many smaller (non-adjacent) ones, thereby precluding larger ones from subsequently being allocated –even though there is sufficient total memory available to accommodate the request. Substituting a pooling allocator, such as theone used in this benchmark (AS7), is a well-known solution to the fragmentationproblems that might otherwise threaten long-running mission-critical systems.”</p>
<p>Newly allocated traversable objects are light-gray. Writing only changes the state of non-gray objects.</p>
<p>When the object is marked during the mark phase, it’s turned dark-gray (mark bit turned black) and pushed onto the gray stack. In case it’s unreachable, the sweep phase can free a light-gray object like any other object marked white.</p>
<p>Dark-gray objects are turned black after traversal (clearing the gray bit) and turned white after sweeping. The write barrier may trigger during this short period and move the barrier back by turning it dark-gray again.</p>
<p>An object that survived one GC cycle is turned white like all other survivors. In case the object is written to after that, it’s turned light-gray again. But this doesn’t push the object onto the gray stack right away! In fact, only the gray bit needs to be flipped, which avoids further barriers as explained above.</p>
<p>The main advantage of the quad-color algorithm is the ultra-cheap write barrier: just check the gray bit, which needs only 2 or 3 machine instructions. And due to the initial coloring and the specific color transitions, write barriers for e.g. tables are hardly ever triggered in practice. The fast path of the write barrier doesn’t need to access the mark bitmap, which avoids polluting the cache with GC metadata while the mutator is running.</p>
<p>The quad-color algorithm can easily fall back to the tri-color algorithm for some traversable objects by turning them white initially and using forward write barriers. And there’s an obvious shortcut for non-traversable objects: marking turns a white object black right away, which touches the mark bitmap only. Since these kind of objects are in segregated arenas, they don’t need to be traversed and their data never needs to be brought into the cache during the mark phase.</p>
<p>Arena-based bump allocator for objects
Cheap write barrier in the common case
Mark-and-compact collection for oldest generation
Copying generational collection for younger generations
Special space (in cache?) for nursery generation
State Transitions</p>
<p>I think it’s better to write a faster GC than to try to special-case various types of allocation. The GC itself can special case things. Optimizing requires global information and only the GC has a global view.</p>
<p>Static immutable data should be interned.</p>
<p>Compress strings with shoco <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Ed-von-Schleck/shoco">https://github.com/Ed-von-Schleck/shoco</a> or  the sequitur algorithm <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sequitur.info/">http://www.sequitur.info/</a>. Maybe can fit into a 64-bit word. Cleaning the dictionary periodically would probably have to happen to avoid resource leaks, which might have to recompress every relevant string. Fortunately, long strings tend to be fairly long-lived.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ollef/sixten">https://github.com/ollef/sixten</a> talks about being able to represent intrusive lists. I experimented with allowing the decision of pointer vs direct storage to be made in pack, but it really simplifies the code a lot to require all pack functions to produce flat blobs of data.</p>
<p>Destructors are inspired by C++ RAII destructors, hence the name. Admittedly the actual API doesn’t bear much resemblance. <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finalizer">Finalizers</a> can resurrect objects and don’t have deterministic execution, hence would be a bad name. Go’s defer statement and try-finally are related, but they only work locally and have imprecise execution semantics.</p>

<h2>Model<a class="headerlink" href="#model" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>For memory management we have to consider values, called objects. Pointers are manually freed and hence don’t need to be managed.</p>
<p>An invalidate queue is more like a store buffer, but it’s part of the memory system, not the CPU. Basically it is a queue that keeps track of invalidations and ensures that they complete properly so that a cache can take ownership of a cache line so it can then write that line. A load queue is a speculative structure that keeps track of in-flight loads in the out of order processor. For example, the following can occur</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>CPU speculatively issue a load from X
That load was in program order after a store to Y, but the address of Y is not resolved yet, so the store does not proceed.
Y is resolved and it turns out to be equal to X. At the time that the store to Y is resolved, that store searches the load queue for speculative loads that have issued, but are present after the store to Y in program order. It will notice the load to X (which is equal to Y) and have to squash those instructions starting with load X and following.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A store buffer is a speculative structure that exists in the CPU, just like the load queue and is for allowing the CPU to speculate on stores. A write combining buffer is part of the memory system and essentially takes a bunch of small writes (think 8 byte writes) and packs them into a single larger transaction (a 64-byte cache line) before sending them to the memory system. These writes are not speculative and are part of the coherence protocol. The goal is to save bus bandwidth. Typically, a write combining buffer is used for uncached writes to I/O devices (often for graphics cards). It’s typical in I/O devices to do a bunch of programming of device registers by doing 8 byte writes and the write combining buffer allows those writes to be combined into larger transactions when shipping them out past the cache.</p>

<h2>Allocator<a class="headerlink" href="#allocator" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>ultimate allocator - steal features from all other allocators. It’s one of those well-researched areas where a few percent lives. Substitution isn’t really an option but maybe some components could be pluggable. Thread safe but values are pure and references can be determined to be thread-local so lots of optimizations.</p>
<p>We want to automatically determine the number of allocation regions and their size to maximize locality.</p>
<p>locate memory leaks - places where allocated memory is never getting freed - memory usage profiling</p>
<p>Handling OOM gracefully - non-allocating subset of language. Should be enough to implement “Release some resources and try again” and “Save the user’s work and exit” strategies. Dumping core is trivial so doesn’t need to be considered.</p>
<p>Layout is usually defined by its size, alignment, padding/stride, and field offsets, but this only specifies the representation of simple flat records. With enumerations, there is the question of how to encode constants. It gets even more complicated with ADTs, like JS’s <a class="reference external" href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2011/05/18/value-representation-in-javascript-implementations">value type</a>, and the choices often impact performance significantly. Finally there is the use of pointers. It complicates the memory management a bit to handle non-contiguous memory layouts, but the algorithms all deal with pointer trees anyway so I don’t think it’s intractable.</p>
<p>The pack/unpack idea is similar to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mgsloan/store/blob/master/store-core/src/Data/Store/Core.hs">store library</a> and the encode/decode functions used by Narcissus <span id="id7">[<a class="reference internal" href="../zzreferences.html#id40" title="Benjamin Delaware, Sorawit Suriyakarn, Clément Pit-Claudel, Qianchuan Ye, and Adam Chlipala.

<p>The state parameter can be gotten rid of by defining <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">S</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">(S,St),</span> <span class="pre">T</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">(T,St)</span></code>:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And we can make encode/decode total by defining <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">S</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">{s</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">exists</span> <span class="pre">t.</span> <span class="pre">(s,t)</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Format}</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">T</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">{t</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">exists</span> <span class="pre">s.</span> <span class="pre">(s,t)</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Format}</span></code>.</p>
<p>I thought about letting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pack</span></code> narrow the range of values, e.g. rounding 1.23 to 1.2, but concluded that it would be surprising if storing a value to memory changed it. The rounding can be defined as a pre-pass over the data to convert it to a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Measurement</span></code> type that then has optimized storage.</p>
<p>One tricky part is that the naive way to specify types interferes with overloading, subtyping and implicit conversions. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pack</span> <span class="pre">(Int8</span> <span class="pre">1)</span></code> can give a byte as expected, but it can also implicitly convert to an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Int32</span></code> and give 4 bytes. Since we have dependent types this isn’t a real issue, just make sure the code generated after representation specialization passes the type explicitly: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pack</span> <span class="pre">Int32</span> <span class="pre">(Int8</span> <span class="pre">1)</span></code>.</p>
<p>A few things need to optimize away for reasonable performance.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">length</span> <span class="pre">.</span> <span class="pre">pack</span></code> should optimize to something like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">const</span> <span class="pre">20</span></code> for most values, or at least something that doesn’t allocate, so that field accesses are independent and values can be allocated sanely. These functions might have to be hacked in, specializing to constant-sized values.</p>
<p>Since writing these serialization functions all the time would be tedious, we can make a format DSL that specifies the functions in a nicer way. Although one of these DSL’s will be the standard / default, it’ll be some kind of macro / constraint system, so defining new format DSLs for specific purposes shouldn’t be hard.</p>
<p>The translation to use pack is pretty simple: every value is wrapped in a call to pack, the result is stored as a tuple <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(cell,unpack)</span></code>, and every usage applies unpack to the cell. The translation uses whatever pack is in scope; pack can be overridden like any other implicit parameters. The unpack functions will end up getting passed around a lot, but function pointers are cheap constants, and constant propagation is a thing, so it shouldn’t be an issue.</p>
<p>A derived pointer is a reference plus an offset. When the address and layout of the object is known we can store the derived pointer as the sum of the value address and offset, allowing direct pointer dereferencing. But since the address is known we could also just store the derived pointer as the offset, so it’s only useful if computing the sum is necessary and expensive.</p>
<p>An object can be treated as an array, N[i] and N.length.</p>
<p>The array part of shared memory is necessary because there is a double-word CAS operation on x86 (CMPXCHG16B), and also for efficiency.</p>
<p>Supporting persistent memory: The pointer API, assembly wrapping, and OS calls cover using persistent memory via standard file APIs or memory-mapped DAX. Memory is volatile while persistent memory is not, so persistent memory is faster storage, not weird RAM. And storage is complex enough that it seems best handled by libraries. Making the memory management system memkind-aware seems possible, like memory bound to NUMA nodes.</p>
<p>With persistent memory only word-sized stores are atomic, hence the choice of shared memory as an array of words. <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46721075/can-modern-x86-hardware-not-store-a-single-byte-to-memory">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46721075/can-modern-x86-hardware-not-store-a-single-byte-to-memory</a> says that there are in fact atomic x86 load/store instructions on the byte level.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>word</dt><dd><p>An integer <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">i</span></code> with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">&lt;=</span> <span class="pre">i</span> <span class="pre">&lt;</span> <span class="pre">MAX</span></code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ternary: in current computers all words are some number of bits. Most discussion of ternary uses pure ternary, but IMO words will be a mixture of trits and bits - the mixture allows approximating the magic radix e more effectively. IDK. Whatever the case, the bit/trit (digit) is the smallest unit of memory, and all other data is a string of digits.</p>
<p>Since no commercially available computers support ternary it is not worth supporting explicitly in the language. But for future-proofing, we must ensure that anytime there is a binary string, the APi can be extended to use a mixed binary/ternary string.</p>
<p>Eliminating pointers entirely is not possible. But we can minimize the lifetime of pointers in the standard library to the duration of the call, and use values / references everywhere else.</p>

<p>Concurrent/incremental GC:
interleave program and GC, GC on separate thread</p>
<p>write barriers or RC increases make every assigment with a heap object on the right hand side a bit more costly. In this case copying the live set can be faster. (related: Appel’s Garbage Collection Can Be Faster Than Stack Allocation)
but this introduces memory churn from allocation, and the dominant portion of the execution time is waiting for the cache lines to be loaded or pre-loaded.
You can actually see this exact behavior when profiling Java applications with high allocation rates, for example. You get weird stats that show that allocation is taking no significant time and GC is taking no significant time, but throughput still sucks. By eliminating the in-the-hot-loop allocations, you can see the throughput go up by a significant factor, sometimes by over an order of magnitude, because it avoids stalling.</p>
<p>The issue is latency for a single request and that can be as little as 150 clocks. In managed GC every allocation manipulates some internal data structure. In JVM it’s a bump of a top of “thread local allocation block” (TLAB) pointer. In cases of high allocation rates, it is very likely that this pointer will have been evicted thus forcing a round trip to main memory. The factor here is rate of allocations, as opposed to rate of bytes allocated which is reported by typical tools.</p>
<p>Measuring memory performance is tricky. The same workload on the same binary can give 2x changes in performance. It’s very sensitive to load order and memory layout. E.g. showing slides during a talk caused the JVM to load in a different memory segment, which changed the results of a timing sensitive calculation which in turn prevented the JVM from doing a memory adaptation that would drop CPU from 100% to 20% and improve latency dramatically.</p>
<p>Generational GC with a tiny live set can win on microbenchmarks, but real programs have large live sets that don’t fit in cache and the data will overflow the young generation before it dies. It’s been tried repeatedly at Sun and failed miserably. You’re better off with the largest young-gen you can get and sucking on the cache misses, OR doing the allocation “by hand” to force rapid (L1-cache-sized) reuse.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Functions means making closures, new scopes, copy/pass parameters, do indirections on returns, memory allocations, etc</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In Rust, this: let x = Vec::with_capacity(10000); for i in 0..10000 {c.push(x)}
avoids resizing/reallocating the vec x because with_capacity specifies the size.
for a_iter_source.iter().collect() there is an optional .size_hint function on the iter that tells how many items it has</p>
<p>in practice asymptotics are BS, and performance depends strongly on memory management. Modeling memory access as O(1) is not correct, due to cache hierarchies - <span id="id9">[<a class="reference internal" href="../zzreferences.html#id86" title="Tomasz Jurkiewicz and Kurt Mehlhorn. The Cost of Address Translation. arXiv:1212.0703 [cs], April 2014. Comment: A extended abstract of this paper was published in the proceedings of ALENEX13, New Orleans, USA. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0703 (visited on 2022-01-04), arXiv:1212.0703.">JM14</a>]</span> ends up with a log(n) overhead for random access, and similarly <a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12388244">this thread</a> says it’s more like O(N^{1/3}) (3D memory architecture), until you near the Bekenstein bound at which point it’s O(N^{1/2}) by the holographic principle. Which of these approximations is right? Who knows, power law fitting is <a class="reference external" href="http://bactra.org//weblog/491.html">hard</a>, none of the articles does a convincing job with the empirical data. But generally, the point is that the effects of memory hierarchies can outweigh the asymptotics. Empirically trees are terrible for caches, indirect lookups hit memory hard.</p>
<p>For pointers, can optimize Maybe&lt;T&gt; to still fit into a pointer (null). Then converting T[] to Maybe&lt;T&gt;[] is a no-op.</p>
<p>The GC can use several pages of stack once it is triggered. It needs a separate stack. Similarly crawling the stack allocates on the stack. Again, use a separate stack, tighten up invariants, and add stack probes.</p>
<p>stack is reserved when the thread is created, and can be committed as well. It’s inadequate to only reserve because Windows has the unfortunate behavior that committing a page of stack can fail even if plenty of memory is available. If the swap file needs to be extended on disk, the attempt to commit can actually time out during this period, giving you a spurious fault.  If you want a robust application, you should always commit your stack reservations eagerly.</p>
<p>The end of the stack reservation consists of an unmapped page that’s a trap for runaway processes, a 1-page buffer for executing stack-overflow backout, and a normal page that generates stack overflow exception when it is allocated past, which will only have a few free bits in an SO condition. So you can really only rely on 1 page to handle SO, which is inadequate. Conclusion: reserve/commit an alternate stack at the beginning to handle SO conditions.</p>
<p>There is a guard bit set on all reserved but uncommitted stack pages.  The stack allocation/deallocation routines must touch/restore stack pages a page at a time, so that these uncommitted pages can be committed and de-committed in order.</p>
<p>getPointer is like C#’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fixed</span></code> block but it allows interleaving. Pinned blocks remain where they are during GC, forcing GC generations to start at awkward locations and causing fragmentation. Pinned objects can be moved to a separate GC area before pinning but this could make fragmentation worse if the pin lifetimes are unpredictable. Efficient patterns are:
- pin for a time shorter than a GC cycle, then GC is unaffected
- pin an old object, then it can be stored statically or in a mature generation
- pin a bunch of objects as a group, then you can use an arena
- pin in a LIFO manner, then you can use a stack in an arena
- pin same-sized objects, then you can use a free list in an arena</p>
<p>A very inefficient pattern is to randomly allocate and pin a large number of randomly-sized objects.</p>
<p>Java’s finalizers have inherent problems because they are associated with GC. In particular, because the GC may not run, Java’s finalizers have no guarantee of timeliness, and hence cannot be used to free resources. In contrast Stroscot’s finalizers free as soon as it is statically known that they are no longer used. Java’s finalizers have no ordering; Stroscot’s run in the order defined. Java’s finalizers do not report exceptions; Stroscot’s finalizer methods are inserted into the program at the point the finalizer is run and can report exceptions. But like Java, the finalizer is considered done regardless of whether it throws an exception. Stroscot’s finalizers are functions and are not directly associated with objects, so there is no possibility of resurrection like in Java.</p>
<p>I concluded after looking at it again that sharing parts of data structures should be pure, so my plan to use immutable references wasn’t going to work because allocating a reference would be impure. So instead there is an allocation interface.</p>

<p>TODO: can it be shared. need some way to coordinate control flow analysis across threads</p>
<p>Destructors are very similar to finalizers. In fact we can use destructors to implement <em>prompt</em> finalizers, that guarantee <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">free</span></code> is called immediately after some <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">use</span></code>:</p>

<p>However, a prompt finalizer would give an error on programs such as the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-haskell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">f</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">newFinalizer</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">print</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;Freed.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

</div>
<p>With a prompt finalizer this program will error. With a normal finalizer, Stroscot will insert calls to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">free</span></code> after the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">use</span> <span class="pre">f</span></code> in the true branch and before the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print</span> <span class="pre">&quot;B&quot;</span></code> statement in the else branch.</p>
<p>Finalizers are as prompt as prompt finalizers, on the programs where prompt finalizers do not error. With this guarantee, finalizers subsume manual memory management. Taking a program written with standard <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">malloc/free</span></code>, we can change it:
1. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">malloc</span></code> is wrapped to return a tuple with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">newPromptFinalizer</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">free</span></code> is replaced with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">use</span></code>
2. every operation is modified to call <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">use</span></code>
3. the prompt finalizer is replaced with a finalizer</p>
<p>The finalizer program compiles identically to the original. Note that this transformation is a bit fragile though - if the uses corresponding to the frees are deleted, the lifetime of the finalizer is shortened and depending on the program structure the point at which <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">free</span></code> should be called may become hard to compute. But hopefully the analysis will be fairly robust and able to handle most cases.</p>
<p>Copying, quad-color incremental, generational garbage collector
Arena-based bump allocator for heap-allocated values
Memory allocator API
Virtual memory API
* POSIX mmap+posix_madvise
* Windows VirtualAlloc</p>
<p>File and network APIs are generally managed by user-level code. So the point of the memory system is to assign a storage location for every value, insert moves / frees where necessary, and overall minimize the amount of resources consumed.</p>
<p>For more advanced programming there is the need to avoid the use of slow storage mechanisms as much as possible by addressing the fast storage mechanisms directly. (Really?)</p>
<p>Memory hierarchy - Place more commonly used items in faster locations - register/cache/memory/disk/recalculate. Items accessed closely together in time should be placed in related locations. Rematerialization recalculates a value instead of loading it from a slow location.</p>
<p>Higher order functions usually require some form of GC as the closures are allocated on the heap. But once you accept GC it is not too tricky, just perform closure conversion or lambda lifting (<a class="reference external" href="https://pp.ipd.kit.edu/uploads/publikationen/graf19sll.pdf">https://pp.ipd.kit.edu/uploads/publikationen/graf19sll.pdf</a>). There is room for optimization as many algorithms work.</p>
<p>Polymorphism requires a uniform representation for types (pointer/box), or templates like C++. Functional languages use a uniform representation so pay an overhead for accessing via the indirection. Unboxing analysis reduces this cost for primitive types - it works pretty well. GHC doesn’t have a particularly good data layout though, because it’s all uniform.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Alias analysis - changing memory references into values</p></li>
<li><p>tail call optimization, Stack height reduction - stack optimizations</p></li>
<li><p>deforestation - remove data structure</p></li>
</ul>
<p>API for requesting memory in an async fashion - memory starvation is often the result of contention, so waiting could get you the memory.
* if you request more than is physically on the system, the request will fail immediately, because that much memory will never become available, barring hot-swapping RAM.
* the API would have to ignore swapping. Otherwise, excessive paging occurs before actual memory exhaustion. So the request succeeds but because it’s backed by the disk performance completely tanks and the user ends up killing the process.
Unfortunately, no OS APIs allow requesting memory asynchronously. The closest you get is Linux’s on-demand backing allocation.</p>

Shenandoah “low pause” is 10ms which is the same order of magnitude as NUMA memory map stuff (&gt;10ms if misconfigured)</p>
<p>cache misses are the most important performance metric for memory management, but not usually measured</p>
<p>escape detection - even with 70% of allocations on stack, not good enough to beat Azul

separate allocator has to be as fast as main allocator</p>
<p>compile time garbage collection is detecting when an allocation becomes unused and freeing it
structure reuse is detecting when an allocation becomes unused and reusing the memory for a new allocation
destructive assignment is when a memory address is passed in and modified by the function</p>
<p>Goroutines have little overhead beyond the memory for the stack, which is just a few kilobytes. Go’s run-time uses resizable, bounded stacks. A newly minted goroutine is given a few kilobytes, which is almost always enough. When it isn’t, the run-time grows (and shrinks) the memory for storing the stack automatically, allowing many goroutines to live in a modest amount of memory. The CPU overhead averages about three cheap instructions per function call. It is practical to create hundreds of thousands of goroutines in the same address space. If goroutines were just threads, system resources would run out at a much smaller number.</p>
<p>The programmer cannot generally predict whether a given code sample will allocate and hence potentially throw an OOM, because of implicit allocations. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Implicit boxing, causing value types to be instantiated on the heap.</p></li>
<li><p>marshaling and unmarshaling for the FFI</p></li>
<li><p>immutable array operations</p></li>
<li><p>graph reduction</p></li>
<li><p>JITing a method or basic block, generating VTables or trampolines</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But if the compiler is able to eliminate all allocations and hence eliminate the possibility of OOM, then these will most likely be consistently eliminated on every compile. So asserting that a function or block can’t OOM is possible. .NET had Constrained Execution Regions which implemented this, with various hacks such JITing the region at load time rather than when the region was first executed. So there’s precedent.</p>
<p>GCC (and later LLVM) added MemorySSA</p>
<p>A scratch buffer, as exemplified by GNU C’s <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Obstacks.html">obstack</a> seems to be an array variable plus metadata. They don’t require any special support AFAICT. But a stack regime is too restrictive.</p>
<p>The TelaMalloc paper seems like a good memory regime. Basically you have allocations (Start Clock Cycle, End Clock Cycle, Size in bytes) and the compiler has to be able to statically determine how to pack them into a memory space. TelaMalloc uses a limited space of size 𝑀, which is a good model for embedded. With a small limit like 8k, you can track the state of each byte and it’s not too much overhead. With a larger limit like the 2GB on video cards you will have to use a tree-like structure to track allocations. On desktop, the allocation limit is generally total physical RAM plus swap minus other running processes. 32-bit also has a limit of 2-3 GB due to virtual addressing.</p>
<p>Allocation randomization such as that found in DieHard or OpenBSD does an isolated allocation for each object at a random address. This allows probabilistically detecting bad pointer arithmetic and buffer overflows because they will access a guard page or fence-post before or after the isolated allocation. It also improves security because malicious code will have to determine the addresses of important objects in order to proceed with an exploit; with careful pointer structure the addresses will not be directly accessible and a brute-force search will have to be used. A “trap page” can detect this brute-force search and abort the program.</p>
<p>Control Flow Guard (CFG) builds a bit map table at compile time of all the legitimate target locations the code can jump too. During the execution of the application, whenever there is a call to jump to a new target location, CFG verifies that the new location was in the bit map table of valid jump locations. If the requested jump location is not listed in the “Valid Jump Locations”, Windows terminates the process thereby preventing the malware from executing.</p>
<p>Data Execution Prevention (DEP) marks various pages as non-executable, specifically the default heap, stack, and memory pools.</p>
<p>Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection (SEHOP): terminate process if SEH chain does not end with correct symbolic record. Also, the linker will produce a table of each image’s safe exception handlers, and the OS will check each SEH entry against these tables.</p>
<p>Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) mainly refers to randomizing the locations of executable and library images in memory, but can also randomize allocations.</p>
<p>DieHard segregates metadata from allocations by putting them in different address ranges. Most allocators store metadata adjacent to the allocation, which improves memory locality but makes it easy to corrupt allocation information.</p>
<p>Many allocators attempt to increase spatial locality by placing objects that are allocated at the same time near each other in memory [11, 14, 25, 40]. DieHard’s random allocation algorithm instead makes it likely that such objects will be distant. This spreading out of objects has little impact on L1 locality because typical heap objects are near or larger than the L1 cache line size (32 bytes on the x86). However, randomized allocation leads to a large number of TLB misses in one application (see Section 7.2.1), and leads to higher resident set sizes because it can induce poor page-level lo- cality. To maintain performance, the in-use portions of the DieHard heap should fit into physical RAM</p>
<p>DieHard’s complete randomization is key to provably avoiding a range of errors with high probability. It reduces the worst-case odds that a buffer overflow has any impact to 50%. The actual likelihood is even lower when the heap is not full. DieHard also avoids dangling pointer errors with very high probability (e.g., 99.999%), making it nearly impervious to such mistakes. You can read the PLDI paper for more details and formulae.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>On 64-bit the address space is so large that there is no need to worry about packing page allocations, you just allocate some number of pages at a random address and deal with packing things into that.</p>
<p>But it is possible to allocate pages at fixed addresses, so conceptually the randomization is just an efficient strategy for when allocations are sparse. The randomization does allow detecting allocation errors via unmapped page access, but Valgrind detects that too.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Program memory usage can be segmented into several types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>frequently accessed data, where reducing the size increases cache performance but they cannot be freed</p></li>
<li><p>infrequently accessed data, where they can be paged to disk but space optimizations don’t have much use. It may be better to free the pages and recreate them when needed.</p></li>
<li><p>dead data, which will be determined to not be needed by a traversal and eventually freed</p></li>
<li><p>leaks, data which has been allocated but will never be used</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Memory usage affects various measurements: paging, cache misses, OOM aborts, and the physical and virtual memory consumption reported in Task Manager.</p>
<p>Basically you track at each program point what is allocated. Then for each allocation you try to find an unused space of sufficient size - this is where the solver comes in because there are constraints. For phi nodes you just combine allocations, so the state is whatever is allocated in either. And for recursion you require the starting and ending allocations to be identical, or warn about unbounded memory usage.
The UI is essentially the compiler says “ok, I know how to compile your program”, or else it errors with an allocation that the compiler can’t figure out how to fit.
there is also the end time… somehow you have to propagate the information of how long a block lives back to the allocation point, so that the allocator can make a good decision. I guess it’s your standard backwards dataflow pass. The hard part is figuring out a good representation of “cycle time” that can handle loops and stuff</p>
<p>well you’ve very helpful so far with the references. let me summarize my position to wrap this up:
* Most programmers do not know or care about atomics at all. If they do use atomics, they will most likely use whatever guarantees sequential consistency. Per the volatile-by-default papers, with Hotspot’s standard barrier coalescing and read caching optimizations, this has a geometric mean overhead of around 50%, with a maximum observed overhead of 167%. For many purposes this magnitude is not significant enough to matter; it’s about the hit you get moving from C++ to Java. And the relaxed annotations significantly reduced the max overhead from 81% to 34%. The fences needed for SC are well-understood and don’t have many optimizations.
* If someone needs performance, most likely they are already at the level where they have picked a platform to optimize for and are looking at the assembly. So the most natural memory model is the hardware’s. These models are fully specified, well-tested to match actual hardware, and have even (in most cases) been signed off by the hardware manufacturers. Using the hardware memory model does mean the programmer has to learn about the different fences and decide which one to use, but I don’t think this task can be avoided if it’s really important to optimize a concurrent program. Implementing compiler optimizations based on a hardware MM seems doable.
* Lastly there are the “portable” C++ and Java memory models (and maybe others like LLVM). These allow execution behavior / optimizations not possible on certain platforms, and maybe even “thin air” behavior of execution not possible on any supported platform. In the thin air case it seems it’s a bug, but apparently in the x86 vs ARM case it’s intended behavior. To avoid confusion, my strategy is to have a literal assembly translation for each atomic operation, so that the behavior is maybe not the fastest but is predictable and consistent.</p>
<p>memory access optimizations: (unconditionally safe only for unshared RAM, but may be allowed depending on memory model and access patterns)
- alias analysis
- reorder loads and stores
- narrowing a store into a bitfield
- rematerializing a load
- Dead Store Elimination (per <span id="id12">[]</span> need to have “secret variables” that can be cleared using “scrubbing stores” that don’t get DSE’d)
- turning loads and stores into a memcpy call
- introducing loads and stores along a codepath where they would not otherwise exist</p>

Micro-mitten: ASAP implementation for a simple Rust like language. Some promising results but his implementation was quite flawed so overall results were negative.
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/doctorn/micro-mitten">https://github.com/doctorn/micro-mitten</a>
ASAP is not ready for production use, it needs more research.
But it fills a hole in the memory management design space.</p>
<p>There is no concise built-in syntax for dereferencing pointers, because there are many different flavours of memory accesses: aligned or unaligned, cached or uncached, secure or non-secure, etc. and it is critical that every memory access is explicit about its flavor. A side effect of putting more information in the access operation is that pointers are untyped, simply a wrapper around bitvectors.</p>
<p>The ‘load’ and ‘store’ instructions are specifically crafted to fully resolve to an element of a memref. These instructions take as arguments n+1 indices for an n-ranked tensor. This disallows the equivalent of pointer arithmetic or the ability to index into the same memref in other ways (something which C arrays allow for example). Furthermore, for the affine constructs, the compiler can follow use-def chains (e.g. through <a class="reference external" href="../Dialects/Affine.md/#affineapply-affineapplyop">affine.apply operations</a> or through the map attributes of <a class="reference external" href="../Dialects/Affine.md/#operations">affine operations</a>) to precisely analyze references at compile-time using polyhedral techniques. This is possible because of the <a class="reference external" href="../Dialects/Affine.md/#restrictions-on-dimensions-and-symbols">restrictions on dimensions and symbols</a>.</p>
<p>A scalar of element-type (a primitive type or a vector type) that is stored in memory is modeled as a 0-d memref. This is also necessary for scalars that are live out of for loops and if conditionals in a function, for which we don’t yet have an SSA representation – <a class="reference external" href="#affineif-and-affinefor-extensions-for-escaping-scalars">an extension</a> to allow that is described later in this doc.</p>
