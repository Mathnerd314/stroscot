<h1>Memory management<a class="headerlink" href="#memory-management" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Rust has an unsafe alter ego
the underlying computer hardware is inherently unsafe.
certain tasks are unsafe.
low-level systems programming
directly interacting with the operating system
writing your own operating system</p>
<p>The malloc/free model is not correct; what we need to keep track of is what will be accessed and where it will be stored. Memory leaks are a pervasive problem, in general there is no real solution besides profiling and buying more RAM. Stroscot can prove memory will not be accessed in the future and hence free it, with a more precise analysis than traditional GC. On the other hand use-after-free and double free can be statically checked for pointers, and aren’t a problem at all for the rest of the language because Stroscot frees automatically.</p>
<p>A scratch buffer, as exemplified by GNU C’s <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Obstacks.html">obstack</a> seems to be an array variable plus metadata. They don’t require any special support AFAICT.</p>
<p>Memory management is not about finding a place to store things. If it was, global storage capacity is measured in zettabytes, so we could just store everything in the cloud. Or hard drives would be sufficient for almost all purposes. The issue is storing and retrieving things in the most efficient way possible, with little overhead - in particular preserving cache locality. Examples:
* A loop that allocates and deallocates a scratch buffer is much more performant if the buffer is allocated to the same location every time - the allocation/deallocation code can even be pulled out of the loop.
* Grouping hot variables into a page, so the page is always loaded and ready
* Grouping things that will be freed together (pools/arenas)</p>
<p>Ownership a la Rust cannot even handle doubly-linked lists so is not worth considering. Code frequently switches to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Rc</span></code> reference counted type, which besides cycles has the semantics of GC. There is even a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Others/shredder">library</a> for a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Gc</span></code> type that does intrusive scanning. GC is more composable and it can also be faster than manual memory management <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="../zzreferences.html#id8" title="Andrew W. Appel. Garbage collection can be faster than stack allocation. Information Processing Letters, 25(4):275–279, June 1987. URL: https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/45.pdf (visited on 2020-07-24), doi:10.1016/0020-0190(87)90175-X.">App87</a>]</span>. As Appel points out, even if freeing an individual object is a single machine instruction, such as a stack pop, freeing a lot of objects still has significant overhead compared to copying out the useful data. But garbage collection scanning slows things down because it pulls in a lot of memory; generational GC reduces this somewhat, but the more interesting area of memory management research is static analysis. To that end some work <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="../zzreferences.html#id80" title="Raphaël L Proust. ASAP: As Static As Possible memory management. Technical Report UCAM-CL-TR-908, University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, July 2017.

Practical Static Memory Management. Bachelor's Thesis, King’s College, May 2020. URL: http://nathancorbyn.com/nc513.pdf.">Cor20</a>]</span> on “as static as possible” (ASAP) memory management is quite relevant. Conceptually we are taking a tracing GC algorithm and replacing the tracing with a compile time analysis that outputs a comparatively small bit of runtime checks. It’s whole program and undecidable, but Stroscot already has 3 or 4 of those planned.</p>
<p>Why hasn’t anyone done static memory management before? Well, the notion of termination analysis only got started in 2007 or so. 10 years later Proust applies the techniques to memory, it’s slow but there is a conceptual leap in going from program verification to program synthesis. It could be faster but I can see why it isn’t.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The newly-dead set for a state transition <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">s</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">t</span></code> is all objects that are accessed before but not accessed later, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">{z</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">Access(s,z)</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">yes</span> <span class="pre">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="pre">Access(t,z)</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">no}</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">L(s)</span> <span class="pre">intersect</span> <span class="pre">D(t)</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We deallocate the newly-dead set after each operation. This doesn’t necessarily reclaim the memory, but ensures freeing is timely if needed. We also can compact the live set by removing dead fields.</p>
<p>Quad-color marking</p>
<p>The GC status of an object is set by two bits, the mark bit and the gray bit. The mark bit is stored in a bitmap, can be white or black. The gray bit is stored in a boxed_value object, determining whether an object has been fully marked. Only traversable objects have a gray bit and hence quad colors. Non-traversable (flat) objects have very simple state transitions (just white-&gt;black-&gt;white).</p>

<p>local (“arena”) allocators speed up short-running programs, keep long–running ones from slowing down over time. All global allocators eventually exhibit diffusion–i.e., memory initially dispensed and therefore (coincidentally) accessed contiguously, over time, ceases to remain so, hence runtime performance invariably degrades. This form of degradation has little to do with the runtime performance of the allocator used, but rather is endemic to the program itself as well as the underlying computer platform, which invariably thrives on locality of reference.”
diffusion should not be confused with fragmentation–an entirely different phenomenon pertaining solely to (“coalescing”) allocators (not covered in this paper) where initially large chunks of contiguous memory decay into many smaller (non-adjacent) ones, thereby precluding larger ones from subsequently being allocated –even though there is sufficient total memory available to accommodate the request. Substituting a pooling allocator, such as theone used in this benchmark (AS7), is a well-known solution to the fragmentationproblems that might otherwise threaten long-running mission-critical systems.”</p>
<p>Newly allocated traversable objects are light-gray. Writing only changes the state of non-gray objects.</p>
<p>When the object is marked during the mark phase, it’s turned dark-gray (mark bit turned black) and pushed onto the gray stack. In case it’s unreachable, the sweep phase can free a light-gray object like any other object marked white.</p>
<p>Dark-gray objects are turned black after traversal (clearing the gray bit) and turned white after sweeping. The write barrier may trigger during this short period and move the barrier back by turning it dark-gray again.</p>
<p>An object that survived one GC cycle is turned white like all other survivors. In case the object is written to after that, it’s turned light-gray again. But this doesn’t push the object onto the gray stack right away! In fact, only the gray bit needs to be flipped, which avoids further barriers as explained above.</p>
<p>The main advantage of the quad-color algorithm is the ultra-cheap write barrier: just check the gray bit, which needs only 2 or 3 machine instructions. And due to the initial coloring and the specific color transitions, write barriers for e.g. tables are hardly ever triggered in practice. The fast path of the write barrier doesn’t need to access the mark bitmap, which avoids polluting the cache with GC metadata while the mutator is running.</p>
<p>The quad-color algorithm can easily fall back to the tri-color algorithm for some traversable objects by turning them white initially and using forward write barriers. And there’s an obvious shortcut for non-traversable objects: marking turns a white object black right away, which touches the mark bitmap only. Since these kind of objects are in segregated arenas, they don’t need to be traversed and their data never needs to be brought into the cache during the mark phase.</p>
<p>Arena-based bump allocator for objects
Cheap write barrier in the common case
Mark-and-compact collection for oldest generation
Copying generational collection for younger generations
Special space (in cache?) for nursery generation
State Transitions</p>
<p>I think it’s better to write a faster GC than to try to special-case various types of allocation. The GC itself can special case things. Optimizing requires global information and only the GC has a global view.</p>
<p>Static immutable data should be interned.</p>
<p>Compress strings with shoco <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Ed-von-Schleck/shoco">https://github.com/Ed-von-Schleck/shoco</a> or  the sequitur algorithm <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sequitur.info/">http://www.sequitur.info/</a>. Maybe can fit into a 64-bit word. Cleaning the dictionary periodically would probably have to happen to avoid resource leaks, which might have to recompress every relevant string. Fortunately, long strings tend to be fairly long-lived.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ollef/sixten">https://github.com/ollef/sixten</a> talks about being able to represent intrusive lists. I experimented with allowing the decision of pointer vs direct storage to be made in pack, but it really simplifies the code a lot to require all pack functions to produce flat blobs of data.</p>
<p>Destructors are inspired by C++ RAII destructors, hence the name. Admittedly the actual API doesn’t bear much resemblance. <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finalizer">Finalizers</a> can resurrect objects and don’t have deterministic execution, hence would be a bad name. Go’s defer statement and try-finally are related, but they only work locally and have imprecise execution semantics.</p>

<h2>Model<a class="headerlink" href="#model" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>For memory management we have to consider values, called objects. Pointers are manually freed and hence don’t need to be managed.</p>
<p>An invalidate queue is more like a store buffer, but it’s part of the memory system, not the CPU. Basically it is a queue that keeps track of invalidations and ensures that they complete properly so that a cache can take ownership of a cache line so it can then write that line. A load queue is a speculative structure that keeps track of in-flight loads in the out of order processor. For example, the following can occur</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>CPU speculatively issue a load from X
That load was in program order after a store to Y, but the address of Y is not resolved yet, so the store does not proceed.
Y is resolved and it turns out to be equal to X. At the time that the store to Y is resolved, that store searches the load queue for speculative loads that have issued, but are present after the store to Y in program order. It will notice the load to X (which is equal to Y) and have to squash those instructions starting with load X and following.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A store buffer is a speculative structure that exists in the CPU, just like the load queue and is for allowing the CPU to speculate on stores. A write combining buffer is part of the memory system and essentially takes a bunch of small writes (think 8 byte writes) and packs them into a single larger transaction (a 64-byte cache line) before sending them to the memory system. These writes are not speculative and are part of the coherence protocol. The goal is to save bus bandwidth. Typically, a write combining buffer is used for uncached writes to I/O devices (often for graphics cards). It’s typical in I/O devices to do a bunch of programming of device registers by doing 8 byte writes and the write combining buffer allows those writes to be combined into larger transactions when shipping them out past the cache.</p>

<section id="allocator">
<h2>Allocator<a class="headerlink" href="#allocator" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>ultimate allocator - steal features from all other allocators. It’s one of those well-researched areas where a few percent lives. Substitution isn’t really an option but maybe some components could be pluggable. Thread safe but values are pure and references can be determined to be thread-local so lots of optimizations.</p>
<p>We want to automatically determine the number of allocation regions and their size to maximize locality.</p>
<p>locate memory leaks - places where allocated memory is never getting freed - memory usage profiling</p>
<p>Handling OOM gracefully - non-allocating subset of language. Should be enough to implement “Release some resources and try again” and “Save the user’s work and exit” strategies. Dumping core is trivial so doesn’t need to be considered.</p>
<p>Layout is usually defined by its size, alignment, padding/stride, and field offsets, but this only specifies the representation of simple flat records. With enumerations, there is the question of how to encode constants. It gets even more complicated with ADTs, like JS’s <a class="reference external" href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2011/05/18/value-representation-in-javascript-implementations">value type</a>, and the choices often impact performance significantly. Finally there is the use of pointers. It complicates the memory management a bit to handle non-contiguous memory layouts, but the algorithms all deal with pointer trees anyway so I don’t think it’s intractable.</p>
<p>The pack/unpack idea is similar to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mgsloan/store/blob/master/store-core/src/Data/Store/Core.hs">store library</a> and the encode/decode functions used by Narcissus <span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="../zzreferences.html#id22" title="Benjamin Delaware, Sorawit Suriyakarn, Clément Pit-Claudel, Qianchuan Ye, and Adam Chlipala.

<p>And we can make encode/decode total by defining <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">S</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">{s</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">exists</span> <span class="pre">t.</span> <span class="pre">(s,t)</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Format}</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">T</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">{t</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">exists</span> <span class="pre">s.</span> <span class="pre">(s,t)</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">Format}</span></code>.</p>
<p>I thought about letting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pack</span></code> narrow the range of values, e.g. rounding 1.23 to 1.2, but concluded that it would be surprising if storing a value to memory changed it. The rounding can be defined as a pre-pass over the data to convert it to a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Measurement</span></code> type that then has optimized storage.</p>
<p>One tricky part is that the naive way to specify types interferes with overloading, subtyping and implicit conversions. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pack</span> <span class="pre">(Int8</span> <span class="pre">1)</span></code> can give a byte as expected, but it can also implicitly convert to an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Int32</span></code> and give 4 bytes. Since we have dependent types this isn’t a real issue, just make sure the code generated after representation specialization passes the type explicitly: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pack</span> <span class="pre">Int32</span> <span class="pre">(Int8</span> <span class="pre">1)</span></code>.</p>
<p>A few things need to optimize away for reasonable performance.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">length</span> <span class="pre">.</span> <span class="pre">pack</span></code> should optimize to something like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">const</span> <span class="pre">20</span></code> for most values, or at least something that doesn’t allocate, so that field accesses are independent and values can be allocated sanely. These functions might have to be hacked in, specializing to constant-sized values.</p>
<p>Since writing these serialization functions all the time would be tedious, we can make a format DSL that specifies the functions in a nicer way. Although one of these DSL’s will be the standard / default, it’ll be some kind of macro / constraint system, so defining new format DSLs for specific purposes shouldn’t be hard.</p>
<p>The translation to use pack is pretty simple: every value is wrapped in a call to pack, the result is stored as a tuple <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(cell,unpack)</span></code>, and every usage applies unpack to the cell. The translation uses whatever pack is in scope; pack can be overridden like any other implicit parameters. The unpack functions will end up getting passed around a lot, but function pointers are cheap constants, and constant propagation is a thing, so it shouldn’t be an issue.</p>
<p>A derived pointer is a reference plus an offset. When the address and layout of the object is known we can store the derived pointer as the sum of the value address and offset, allowing direct pointer dereferencing. But since the address is known we could also just store the derived pointer as the offset, so it’s only useful if computing the sum is necessary and expensive.</p>
<p>An object can be treated as an array, N[i] and N.length.</p>
<p>The array part of shared memory is necessary because there is a double-word CAS operation on x86 (CMPXCHG16B), and also for efficiency.</p>
<p>Supporting persistent memory: The pointer API, assembly wrapping, and OS calls cover using persistent memory via standard file APIs or memory-mapped DAX. Memory is volatile while persistent memory is not, so persistent memory is faster storage, not weird RAM. And storage is complex enough that it seems best handled by libraries. Making the memory management system memkind-aware seems possible, like memory bound to NUMA nodes.</p>
<p>With persistent memory only word-sized stores are atomic, hence the choice of shared memory as an array of words. <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46721075/can-modern-x86-hardware-not-store-a-single-byte-to-memory">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46721075/can-modern-x86-hardware-not-store-a-single-byte-to-memory</a> says that there are in fact atomic x86 load/store instructions on the byte level.</p>
<p>Memory models: The actual hardware models (x86-TSO, Armv8 whatever, etc.) seem to be the most well-specified. Whereas C++11 is broken, Java was broken, … in the sense that the described memory model was unimplementable on hardware, preventing outcomes possible in hardware, or else allowed outcomes that hardware would not (e.g. reading values out of thin air). So use the hardware models. For cross-platform programming allow checking model compatibility, i.e. that the two memory models make the program produce equivalent results,</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>word</dt><dd><p>An integer <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">i</span></code> with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">&lt;=</span> <span class="pre">i</span> <span class="pre">&lt;</span> <span class="pre">MAX</span></code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ternary: in current computers all words are some number of bits. Most discussion of ternary uses pure ternary, but IMO words will be a mixture of trits and bits - the mixture allows approximating the magic radix e more effectively. IDK. Whatever the case, the bit/trit (digit) is the smallest unit of memory, and all other data is a string of digits.</p>
<p>Since no commercially available computers support ternary it is not worth supporting explicitly in the language. But for future-proofing, we must ensure that anytime there is a binary string, the APi can be extended to use a mixed binary/ternary string.</p>
<p>Eliminating pointers entirely is not possible. But we can minimize the lifetime of pointers in the standard library to the duration of the call, and use values / references everywhere else.</p>

<p>Concurrent/incremental GC:
interleave program and GC, GC on separate thread</p>
<p>write barriers or RC increases make every assigment with a heap object on the right hand side a bit more costly. In this case copying the live set can be faster. (related: Appel’s Garbage Collection Can Be Faster Than Stack Allocation)
but this introduces memory churn from allocation, and the dominant portion of the execution time is waiting for the cache lines to be loaded or pre-loaded.
You can actually see this exact behavior when profiling Java applications with high allocation rates, for example. You get weird stats that show that allocation is taking no significant time and GC is taking no significant time, but throughput still sucks. By eliminating the in-the-hot-loop allocations, you can see the throughput go up by a significant factor, sometimes by over an order of magnitude, because it avoids stalling.</p>
<p>The issue is latency for a single request and that can be as little as 150 clocks. In managed GC every allocation manipulates some internal data structure. In JVM it’s a bump of a top of “thread local allocation block” (TLAB) pointer. In cases of high allocation rates, it is very likely that this pointer will have been evicted thus forcing a round trip to main memory. The factor here is rate of allocations, as opposed to rate of bytes allocated which is reported by typical tools.</p>
<p>Measuring memory performance is tricky. The same workload on the same binary can give 2x changes in performance. It’s very sensitive to load order and memory layout. E.g. showing slides during a talk caused the JVM to load in a different memory segment, which changed the results of a timing sensitive calculation which in turn prevented the JVM from doing a memory adaptation that would drop CPU from 100% to 20% and improve latency dramatically.</p>
<p>Generational GC with a tiny live set can win on microbenchmarks, but real programs have large live sets that don’t fit in cache and the data will overflow the young generation before it dies. It’s been tried repeatedly at Sun and failed miserably. You’re better off with the largest young-gen you can get and sucking on the cache misses, OR doing the allocation “by hand” to force rapid (L1-cache-sized) reuse.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Functions means making closures, new scopes, copy/pass parameters, do indirections on returns, memory allocations, etc</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In Rust, this: let x = Vec::with_capacity(10000); for i in 0..10000 {c.push(x)}
avoids resizing/reallocating the vec x because with_capacity specifies the size.
for a_iter_source.iter().collect() there is an optional .size_hint function on the iter that tells how many items it has</p>
<p>in practice asymptotics are BS, and performance depends strongly on memory management. Modeling memory access as O(1) is not correct, due to cache hierarchies - <span id="id6">[<a class="reference internal" href="../zzreferences.html#id55" title="Tomasz Jurkiewicz and Kurt Mehlhorn. The Cost of Address Translation. arXiv:1212.0703 [cs], April 2014. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0703 (visited on 2022-01-04), arXiv:1212.0703.">JM14</a>]</span> ends up with a log(n) overhead for random access, and similarly <a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12388244">this thread</a> says it’s more like O(N^{1/3}) (3D memory architecture), until you near the Bekenstein bound at which point it’s O(N^{1/2}) by the holographic principle. Which of these approximations is right? Who knows, power law fitting is <a class="reference external" href="http://bactra.org//weblog/491.html">hard</a>, none of the articles does a convincing job with the empirical data. But generally, the point is that the effects of memory hierarchies can outweigh the asymptotics. Empirically trees are terrible for caches, indirect lookups hit memory hard.</p>
<p>For pointers, can optimize Maybe&lt;T&gt; to still fit into a pointer (null). Then converting T[] to Maybe&lt;T&gt;[] is a no-op.</p>
<p>The GC can use several pages of stack once it is triggered. It needs a separate stack. Similarly crawling the stack allocates on the stack. Again, use a separate stack, tighten up invariants, and add stack probes.</p>
<p>stack is reserved when the thread is created, and can be committed as well. It’s inadequate to only reserve because Windows has the unfortunate behavior that committing a page of stack can fail even if plenty of memory is available. If the swap file needs to be extended on disk, the attempt to commit can actually time out during this period, giving you a spurious fault.  If you want a robust application, you should always commit your stack reservations eagerly.</p>
<p>The end of the stack reservation consists of an unmapped page that’s a trap for runaway processes, a 1-page buffer for executing stack-overflow backout, and a normal page that generates stack overflow exception when it is allocated past, which will only have a few free bits in an SO condition. So you can really only rely on 1 page to handle SO, which is inadequate. Conclusion: reserve/commit an alternate stack at the beginning to handle SO conditions.</p>
<p>There is a guard bit set on all reserved but uncommitted stack pages.  The stack allocation/deallocation routines must touch/restore stack pages a page at a time, so that these uncommitted pages can be committed and de-committed in order.</p>
<p>getPointer is like C#’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fixed</span></code> block but it allows interleaving. Pinned blocks remain where they are during GC, forcing GC generations to start at awkward locations and causing fragmentation. Pinned objects can be moved to a separate GC area before pinning but this could make fragmentation worse if the pin lifetimes are unpredictable. Efficient patterns are:
- pin for a time shorter than a GC cycle, then GC is unaffected
- pin an old object, then it can be stored statically or in a mature generation
- pin a bunch of objects as a group, then you can use an arena
- pin in a LIFO manner, then you can use a stack in an arena
- pin same-sized objects, then you can use a free list in an arena</p>
<p>A very inefficient pattern is to randomly allocate and pin a large number of randomly-sized objects.</p>
<p>Java’s finalizers have inherent problems because they are associated with GC. In particular, because the GC may not run, Java’s finalizers have no guarantee of timeliness, and hence cannot be used to free resources. In contrast Stroscot’s finalizers free as soon as it is statically known that they are no longer used. Java’s finalizers have no ordering; Stroscot’s run in the order defined. Java’s finalizers do not report exceptions; Stroscot’s finalizer methods are inserted into the program at the point the finalizer is run and can report exceptions. But like Java, the finalizer is considered done regardless of whether it throws an exception. Stroscot’s finalizers are functions and are not directly associated with objects, so there is no possibility of resurrection like in Java.</p>
<p>I concluded after looking at it again that sharing parts of data structures should be pure, so my plan to use immutable references wasn’t going to work because allocating a reference would be impure. So instead there is an allocation interface.</p>

<p>Destructors are very similar to finalizers. In fact we can use destructors to implement <em>prompt</em> finalizers, that guarantee <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">free</span></code> is called immediately after some <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">use</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-haskell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">newPromptFinalizer</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">free</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="w"></span>

<p>However, a prompt finalizer would give an error on programs such as the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-haskell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">free</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">print</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;Freed.&quot;</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="nf">f</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">newFinalizer</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">free</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="nf">use</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">f</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="nf">b</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">input</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">Bool</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="kr">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">b</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="n">print</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;A&quot;</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="n">use</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">f</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="kr">else</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="n">print</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;B&quot;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>

<p>With a normal finalizer, instead of erroring, Stroscot will insert a call to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">free</span></code> before the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print</span> <span class="pre">&quot;B&quot;</span></code> statement in the else branch.</p>
<p>Finalizers are as prompt as prompt finalizers, on the programs where prompt finalizers do not error. With this guarantee, finalizers subsume manual memory management. Taking a program written with standard <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">malloc/free</span></code>, we can change it:
1. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">malloc</span></code> is wrapped to return a tuple with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">newPromptFinalizer</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">free</span></code> is replaced with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">use</span></code>
2. every operation is modified to call <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">use</span></code>
3. the prompt finalizer is replaced with a finalizer</p>
<p>The finalizer program compiles identically to the original. Note that this transformation is a bit fragile though - if the uses corresponding to the frees are deleted, the lifetime of the finalizer is shortened and depending on the program structure the point at which <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">free</span></code> should be called may become hard to compute. But hopefully the analysis will be fairly robust and able to handle most cases.</p>
<p>Copying, quad-color incremental, generational garbage collector
Arena-based bump allocator for heap-allocated values
Memory allocator API
Virtual memory API
* POSIX mmap+posix_madvise
* Windows VirtualAlloc</p>
<p>File and network APIs are generally managed by user-level code. So the point of the memory system is to assign a storage location for every value, insert moves / frees where necessary, and overall minimize the amount of resources consumed.</p>
<p>For more advanced programming there is the need to avoid the use of slow storage mechanisms as much as possible by addressing the fast storage mechanisms directly. (Really?)</p>
<p>Memory hierarchy - Place more commonly used items in faster locations - register/cache/memory/disk/recalculate. Items accessed closely together in time should be placed in related locations. Rematerialization recalculates a value instead of loading it from a slow location.</p>
<p>Higher order functions usually require some form of GC as the closures are allocated on the heap. But once you accept GC it is not too tricky, just perform closure conversion or lambda lifting (<a class="reference external" href="https://pp.ipd.kit.edu/uploads/publikationen/graf19sll.pdf">https://pp.ipd.kit.edu/uploads/publikationen/graf19sll.pdf</a>). There is room for optimization but many algorithms work.</p>
<p>Polymorphism requires a uniform representation for types (pointer/box), or templates like C++. Functional languages use a uniform representation so pay an overhead for accessing via the indirection. Unboxing analysis reduces this cost for primitive types - it works pretty well. GHC doesn’t have a particularly good data layout though, because it’s all uniform.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Alias analysis - changing memory references into values</p></li>
<li><p>tail call optimization, Stack height reduction - stack optimizations</p></li>
<li><p>deforestation - remove data structure</p></li>
</ul>
<p>API for requesting memory in an async fashion - memory starvation is often the result of contention, so waiting could get you the memory.
* if you request more than is physically on the system, the request will fail immediately, because that much memory will never become available, barring hot-swapping RAM.
* the API would have to ignore swapping. Otherwise, excessive paging occurs before actual memory exhaustion. So the request succeeds but because it’s backed by the disk performance completely tanks and the user ends up killing the process.
Unfortunately, no OS APIs allow requesting memory asynchronously. The closest you get is Linux’s on-demand backing allocation.</p>
