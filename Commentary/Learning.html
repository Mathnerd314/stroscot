<h1>Learning<a class="headerlink" href="#learning" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>There is clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date documentation. It is easy for developers experienced with other languages to get started. There is a large and active community of users providing guidance and support. Programs run quickly and scale well. It is easy for experienced developers to understand and maintain programs.</p>
<p>Learning a language takes time and effort. Typically, programmers are pressed for time, so the goal would be to learn a “minimum viable amount” of Stroscot in a short period of time. As a project, Stroscot should provide resources to help programmers learn Stroscot efficiently and in as pleasant a manner as possible.</p>
<section id="formats">
<h2>Formats<a class="headerlink" href="#formats" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Learning content can be provided in different ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Lecture (5% retention): The traditional “stand and deliver” lecture is not very effective at teaching compared to other methods, but it is cheap and easy to produce and the traditional format of teaching.</p></li>
<li><p>Literature (10% retention): Books, online tutorials, and official languages references provide comprehensive and structured learning material. They often offer in-depth explanations, examples, exercises, and best practices. How long should it be? A <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Python-Programming-Beginners-Comprehensive-Hands/dp/B0BFV21L24/">121 page Python book (60 pages double spaced)</a> is derided as terse and useless, requiring to google every new keyword. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Language-2nd-Edition/dp/0131103628/">K&amp;R C</a> has 272 pages, but is “not beginner friendly”. The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.csharpcourse.com/">C# Programming Yellow Book</a>  is 217 8.5x11 pages or about 322 of the standard 7x9 pages. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Python-Kids-Playful-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593274076/">Python for Kids</a> clocks in at 344 pages but is still missing critical functions such as the input command. On the other hand some chapters such as turtle graphics, tkinter, and classes/objects can be skipped (74 pages). My first programming book <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Programming-Java-Dummies-Computers/dp/0764526464/">Beginning Programming with Java For Dummies</a> had 408 pages. The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Programming-Java-Dummies-Computer/dp/1119235537/">5th edition</a> is the most popular and has 560 pages. But it still only covers the basics. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-2nd-Edition/dp/0596009208/">Head First Java</a> is recommended by the r/learnprogramming subreddit and has 688 pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Video Courses (20%-30% retention): Video courses offer visual and auditory learning experiences. mainly in the form of lectures and coding examples. YouTube has numerous X-hour courses on various subjects, from universities and individuals. On YouTube <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">`</span></a>MIT</p></li>
</ul>
<p>6.0001 &lt;<a class="reference external" href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/video_galleries/lecture-videos/">https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/video_galleries/lecture-videos/</a>&gt;` is around 12x45=540 minutes. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T3817j24-GogXmWqO5Q5vYy0V">CS50P</a> is 14x1.2=1005 minutes. The amateur <cite>CS Dojo &lt;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBZBJbE_rGRWeh5mIBhD-hhDwSEDxogDg&gt;</cite> is 16x~13=217 minutes. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0845FEB57E5894C2">Digilent Inc.’s course</a> is 87x6.5=561 minutes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Quizzes (? retention): Some basic tests allow quickly identifying areas where one’s knowledge is deficient. Students will learn things from seeing their wrong answers and an explanation of the correct answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Online platforms (75% retention): Online platforms such as edX, Udacity, and Coursera, besides offering videos, also offer interactive coding exercises, challenges, and projects. These can be highly effective for learning by doing. These platforms provide a hands-on learning experience where you can write, run, and test code directly in a web browser. They often offer immediate feedback and guidance to reinforce learning. Coursera’s <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program">Learn to program</a> course is 291 minutes or less than 5 hours of video content but there are 43 readings and Coursera says it will take 25 hours to complete.</p></li>
<li><p>Communities and Forums (50% retention): Participating in chats, communities and forums can be a valuable learning resource. Engaging with peers, mentors, and experts allows you to ask questions, seek guidance, and learn from others’ experiences. It’s a great way to stay updated with the latest trends and best practices, if other resources are not sufficient.</p></li>
<li><p>Active learning (90%): Trying out the programming language and directly learning what works and what doesn’t is the most effective method of learning, after the basics are covered.</p></li>
<li><p>In-person instruction (5%-90% depending on activity): Although most programming languages are self-taught (SO 2019: 85.5% of respondents taught themselves a new language, framework, or tool without taking a formal course), one’s first programming language is usually learned in a course. If Stroscot indeed takes over the world then it will be people’s first programming language (or second, after an introductory graphical language), and they will most likely learn it via in-person instruction.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="experience">
<h2>Experience<a class="headerlink" href="#experience" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Having experience with other language can make learning Stroscot faster, but other languages can also bring over preconceptions, causing “interference”. For example in <span id="id3">[]</span>, imperative concepts became misconceptions in functional programming: variables can be defined after they are used, operators like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tail</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">take</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">drop</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">remove</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">filter</span></code> do not mutate their arguments, and there is no need to clone results to prevent them from being mutated and corrupted. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd04xx/EWD498.PDF">Dijkstra</a> similarly stated that COBOL “cripples the mind” and BASIC “mentally mutilates programmers beyond hope of regeneration”.</p>
<p>Probably Dijkstra overreaches when he states “beyond hope of regeneration” - although learning other styles of programming may introduce habits that are bad in the context of Stroscot, it is possible to unlearn habits. According to research on drug and alcohol abuse, there are several techniques:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>practice self-control by exercising a little bit of willpower every day</p></li>
<li><p>identify triggers for the bad habits and work out ways to avoid those triggers</p></li>
<li><p>map out positive routines and new habits to replace the old habits</p></li>
<li><p>get support and track failures and successes over time</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Per <a class="reference external" href="https://www.thebioneer.com/hackers-brain-the-psychology-of-programming/">this</a>  the main dopamine reward for programmers is when their code compiles and works. So in order to correct bad programming habits, the compiler must withold success from the programmer, e.g. by reporting warnings on the bad style of coding and refusing to run the program.</p>
</section>
<section id="neuroscience">
<h2>Neuroscience<a class="headerlink" href="#neuroscience" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We can distinguish many tasks in programming:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>designing code - often happens purely in the head. Programmers take long walks or similar to figure out a problem, and then when they got home, they simply write out the code they have thought of. The “hard part” happens away from the computer.</p></li>
<li><p>writing code - mechanical typing, hard to tell if it’s very cognitive</p></li>
<li><p>skimming code - relies on the language centres of the brain, the ventral lateral prefrontal cortex. (citation needed)</p></li>
<li><p>reading code carefully for bugs</p></li>
<li><p>learning a new programming language</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these have different demands on the brain and people will be better at different aspects.</p>
<p>Programming misconceptions aren’t likely to release dopamine,</p>
<p>For experienced programmers, a specific “Stroscot for Y programmers” guide series should be sufficient to retrain programmers away from their bad habits.</p>
<p>working memory - when you’re thinking of a sequence of events, you need to keep the line of logical reasoning held in your working memory</p>
<p>flow state - it’s easy to think ‘just one more compile’ and end up staying up all night.</p>
<p>coding provides an immediate feedback loop with testing and seeing the results. This releases Dopamine (citation needed)</p>
<p>TODO: check out the Unified Learning Model book</p>
