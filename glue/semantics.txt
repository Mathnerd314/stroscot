eval (s=Symbol) env = lookup s env
eval (x:xs) = combine (eval x env) xs env
eval x = x

combine combiner operands env
  | operative combiner = operate combiner operands env
  | applicative combiner = combine (unwrap combiner) (map-eval operands env) env

optimal lambda reduction
-> forces graph reduction as the evaluation technique
stored as an adjacency list / heap of records since we expect it to be tree-like
