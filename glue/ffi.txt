General programming needs to interface with existing libraries. So far the most promising interface is Zig.

Zig's cImport FFI works as follows:
- build buffer of #include and other preprocessor statements
- write to hashed location/cInclude.h
- create ASTUnit with clang::ASTUnit::LoadFromCommandLine
- walk with visitLocalTopLevelDecls
- use -detailed-preprocessing-record to obtain macro definitions
see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13881506/retrieve-information-about-pre-processor-directives
- use MX MD MF to get dependencies for invalidating the cache
- generate Zig AST and write to file
- import with normal transclusion

Also notable is Goo, which allows snippets of code like $( GL_LINE_LOOP ) to be evaluated using a quotation interface. I think he only gets away with it because C is the target compile language though. True non-compiled inline C would need something like the Cling interpreter.
