General programming needs to interface with existing libraries. So far the most promising interface is Zig.

Zig's cImport FFI works as follows:
- build buffer of #include and other preprocessor statements
- write to hashed location/cInclude.h
- create ASTUnit with clang::ASTUnit::LoadFromCommandLine
- walk with visitLocalTopLevelDecls
- use -detailed-preprocessing-record to obtain macro definitions

- use MX MD MF to get dependencies for invalidating the cache
- generate Zig AST and write to file
- import with normal transclusion
