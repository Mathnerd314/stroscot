Comparing two elements of a poset produces one of LT GT EQ or INC. We say x < y, x > y, x = y, or x ~ y (x and y are incomparable).

compare a a = EQ
compare x y = converse (compare y x) where
  converse EQ = EQ
  converse LT = GT
  converse GT = LT
  converse INC = INC

We exclude compare x y = INC, compare y x = EQ/GT/LT, because < is the dual of >, and similarly = is symmetric.

compare x z = trans (compare x y, compare y z) where
  trans s EQ = s
  trans EQ t = t
  trans LT LT = LT
  trans GT GT = GT
  trans _ _ = anything

We can define the relations <= and >= using this.

a <= b = compare a b elemOf {EQ,LT}
a >= b = compare a b elemOf {EQ,GT}





 Given two posets A and B the lexicographical order on the Cartesian product A times B is defined as

  (a,b)≤(a',b') if and only if a<a' or (a<=~a' and b≤b')

  a ~ c, c ~ e, a > e
  b < d < f

  ⟨a,b⟩⪯⟨c,d⟩⪯⟨e,f⟩

  a <=~ c <=~ e
  if a < c and c <= e, or a <= c and c < e then a < e and ⟨a,b⟩⪯⟨e,f⟩.
  Otherwise we have
    a < c ~ e, d<=f
    a ~= c =~ e, b <= d <= f - so b<=f
    a ~ c < e, b <=d

  we have b≤Bd and d≤Bf, so b≤Bf, and again ⟨a,b⟩⪯⟨e,f⟩.+
