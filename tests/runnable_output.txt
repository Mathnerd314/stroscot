I don't really like how implicit building an executable is in most compiled languages.
There's no obvious entry point where you can say "this is me invoking the compiler", so it forces a 2-level system of shell and program.

I'd rather write something like:
writeFile (compileToExecutable main)

where it's clear that compileToExecutable is doing the work.
