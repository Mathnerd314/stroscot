<h1>Build system<a class="headerlink" href="#build-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Stroscot’s build system is called “Cot”. Although build systems are often an afterthought in programming language design, they interface with the compiler in several areas, so it is better to integrate the build system into the compiler as a library. That way intermediate results such as checked/optimized functions can be stored efficiently and rebuilt only when needed. What is usually called “separate compilation” is actually incremental compilation. Compilation’s goal is to produce a single executable / DLL, so these “separate” files are still part of the same assembly. Object files are simply one way of storing intermediate results so that compilation work done on the files can be shared; but it does not handle some patterns, e.g. recursive references. Also, the compiler’s include-following mechanism can be tightly integrated with the build system, so that generated files can be created before they are used. Finally the compiler’s source code will need a build system to manage the complexity of the build.</p>

<p>Broadly, a build system is an execution engine combined with logic for incremental computing.
A clean build starts with inputs, which the execution engine uses to execute to completion to produce the set of outputs. For most builds, we also have reference to the previous runs of the engine. In the simplest case it is only the trace of the previous run that is available, but a caching build system with constructive traces (“build farm”) can maintain many sets of traces in parallel and interpolate between them.</p>
<p>Logically, there is a clear separation between inputs and outputs. If the build system creates the data, it is an output, otherwise it’s an input. If we modify a file during the build, e.g. a source code formatter tidying up, this is an input (the original file) and an output (the tidied file) indexed by the same key. We can always remove the confusion by backing up the input, running the build, moving the output to a different key, and restoring the input.</p>
<p>If an input is overwritten before any data is read, then it is not actually used and the key is an output key. Detecting this in a filesystem tracer might be tricky.</p>
<p>If an output is modified or deleted, the clean build semantics dictates that it will be regenerated from the inputs. But a lot of the time we don’t care about most of the outputs (intermediate files) so Stroscot includes damage handling logic to compute the minimal rebuild for the desired outputs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="design">
<h2>Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It’s based on iThreads (<a class="bibtex reference internal" href="zzreferences.html#bhatotiaithreadsthreadinglibrary2015" id="id1">[BFA+15]</a>), which out of a few dozen incremental computation papers seemed the most appealing. The approach supports arbitrary multithreaded shared-memory programs, and hence imposes no requirements on the overall flow of the build. Instead, it requires structuring the build into fine-grained units of computation called thunks. Thunks are the smallest addressable unit of execution and constrain the amount of re-use that an incremental build can achieve. A thunk reads and writes the shared memory as it pleases, so long as it avoids data races with other concurrently executing thunks, and then calls a synchronization operation. Synchronization operations enforce control dependencies and structure the flow of time in the program. Stroscot implements a sequencing operation based on Shake’s concurrency support as well as acquire/release lock from the paper. It is relatively simple to add new concurrency operations so long as they are of type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">IO</span> <span class="pre">()</span></code>.</p>
<p>Two thunks conflict if they access the same key, and at least one is a write. Data races are conflicting accesses not ordered by synchronization. To ensure that two conflicting ordinary operations do not happen simultaneously, they must be ordered by intervening synchronization operations. For example, one thunk could write a variable and then release a lock; other thunks must acquire the lock before accessing the variable, so that there is a locking operation intervening. If the build is not data race free it might  execution orders produce the same results. This is not checked thoroughly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="thunk-names">
<h2>Thunk names<a class="headerlink" href="#thunk-names" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Thunk naming adds some complexity to the implementation of a build system, as the thunk names also affect the way computations can be re-used. From the implementation side there is no restriction on the names; they can be any sequence of bytes. iThreads uses a simple “thread # thunk #” scheme, which assumes a fixed number of long-running threads and invalidates all of the thunks in a thread after a modified thunk. A scheme similar to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span></code> uses filenames; for each file f there are two thunks “run f” and “exec f”. The “run f” just does <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Sequence</span> <span class="pre">[subtargets,[exec</span> <span class="pre">f]]</span></code> while “exec f” runs the commands that generate f. But with fine-grained dependency tracking we can track each command separately - we could use thunk names like “exec f step #” but this leads to invalidating later thunks. Using names like “exec f step cmd” requires a lot of boilerplate names to be written out. The ideal solution is probably some form of structural hashing.</p>
<p>Also, in a dynamic build, a direct file action map like this is not always available, and so the naming scheme must be relaxed to allow dependencies on things that aren’t files. For example, we may have one command that generates two files; so long as we use a consistent thunk name for this command there is no issue. For another example, we may have include headers that are picked up in a search path directory listing. To deal with this directly, we would need to introduce build logic into the search mechanism and run dependencies when seeing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#include</span></code>. But a phase separation handles it fine with minimal changes - we generate the files first and then call the compiler, filling in the build dependencies from an output list of used headers. In this case we would need thunks for each phase.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="model">
<h2>Model<a class="headerlink" href="#model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To reason about the code we need a pencil-and-paper model of how it works. First we have thunk IDs (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tid</span></code> s); these come from the program and are quoted strings “abc”. For key names we use unquoted strings xyz and for key values integers 123; these are only compared for equality (often they are modification times). Then for the traces we use a tabular format to record the reads, writes, and synchronization operations. We might have databases from multiple runs available, so there is also a “machine” column, but this is the same for all rows in a single trace so it is omitted. An example database based on the example in <a class="bibtex reference internal" href="zzreferences.html#shalbuildsystemrules2009" id="id2">[Sha09]</a> might be</p>

<p>Square nodes represent thunks while circular nodes are keys (files). Black lines are reads. Blue lines are writes. Dotted gray lines are sequenced to execute before solid gray lines. Overall, the graph structure is very similar to Pluto’s two-level graph, but the control structure is more complex - Pluto simply has build-require, while Cot has various synchronization operations.</p>
<p>Then during an incremental run we start with a list of changed keys and their values; this is allowed to contain unmodified keys, so generating this list may be as simple as calculating the state of all keys and saying they all might be modified, or it may be a more precise list from a filesystem watcher or similar API. The keys can also include volatile information such as FTP server listings or stdin.</p>

<p>Here main.c’s modification time has been updated. We start from the top and load “run prog”; there are no changed inputs (or indeed any inputs), so we skip execution of the thunk, perform the record write operations to the key state, and execute the synchronization operation, which loads “run main”. “run main” loads “yacc” which has not changed, so control returns to “run main” and “cc main” is loaded. “cc main“‘s inputs have changed, so we run it, producing an updated main.o. Meanwhile “run parse” and “cc parse” have been loaded with no changes. Control returns to “run prog” and “ld” is executed as its inputs have changed, building the final executable “prog”.</p>

<h2>Thunk state<a class="headerlink" href="#thunk-state" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Thunk state is a bit tricky to define precisely. So let’s work it out.</p>
<p>First we define execution state. A thunk is enabled once a synchronization operation requests to execute the thunk. A thunk is resolved once it is enabled and its synchronization operation has begun execution. So a thunk starts out disabled, becomes enabled, and then is resolved.</p>
<p>If a thunk is never enabled, then in a clean build the thunk would not be executed at all. There are two possibilities:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>unused: The thunk is not referenced by any trace or by the current build. Example: almost any arbitrary thunk id</p></li>
<li><p>stale: The thunk is referenced by some trace but is not enabled anytime in the current build. Example: control flow change</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If a thunk is enabled, then we can consider the available traces and compare them with the keystate at the point the thunk is enabled. There is one trivial possibility:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>new: The thunk is not referenced by any trace but has been enabled in the current build. Examples: control flow change, clean build</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When we have at least one trace, things get more interesting. A trace is valid if all of its recorded reads match the state of the build. There is also relevancy; a key is relevant if it might have changed this run, relative to the previous run.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>dirty: There are traces but no valid trace. Example: input change</p></li>
<li><p>clean: There is a valid trace where all recorded writes match the state on disk. Example: A thunk is always clean immediately after it is executed, since running a thunk records its trace.</p></li>
<li><p>damaged: There is at least one valid trace but no valid trace has its recorded writes matching the state on disk. Examples: shallow build, external modification, overwritten output</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After resolving the thunk, it can only be clean or damaged; the clean state may have been achieve by substitution, reuse, or rebuilding, while the damaged state can only be from a damaged thunk passing the no-future-use check.</p>
<p>In a cloud build setting we have one more state to handle constructive traces. A constructive trace stores the full value for each key and allows fetching the output files without running the build.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>substitutable: There is a valid constructive trace.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A substitutable thunk can be clean or damaged but not dirty. So in total we have 8 states: unused, stale, new, dirty, clean-nonsubstitutable, clean-substitutable, damaged-nonsubstitutable, and damaged-substitutable. It’s a lot, but Cot deals with a lot of functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="simulation">
<h2>Simulation<a class="headerlink" href="#simulation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It’s possible for a thunk to be handled in several ways: leave damaged/clean, rebuild, or substitute with one of the applicable versions. These also have different costs: leaving things alone is free, substituting costs some amount of network bandwidth time / decompression, while rebuilding’s cost is unknown but can be estimated from other builds. But to figure out the least-cost action overall we need a global view of the build. Dmaaged thunks can only be left alone if they are not need during the rest of the build, i.e. no thunk reading the damaged data is rebuilding. Substitutions from different sources may be incompatible (e.g. GHC used to produce <a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/4012">randomized symbols names</a>), so picking the version is not as simple as first from a list.</p>
<p>The problem is NP-hard since we can encode 3-SAT in the substitution versions <a class="bibtex reference internal" href="zzreferences.html#coxversionsat2016" id="id3">[Cox16]</a>. But of course, it it’s that hard, we might as well use a SAT solver. In particular we can encode it as an instance of partial weighted MaxSAT. First we have a lot of hard constraints:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>each thunk can be left alone, substituted, or built, and we can only do one: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">t_leave</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">t_rebuild</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">t_v1</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">...</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">t_vn</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code> (this is a pseudo-Boolean constraint that be easily encoded)</p></li>
<li><p>compatibility on the read/write values, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">t_vj</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">(s_vx</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">s_vy</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">...)</span></code>, where t reads a value that s writes and x,y, etc. are the versions that are compatible (this leaves out rebuilding, which could generate identical data)</p></li>
<li><p>a conservative assumption that rebuilding changes all outputs to new versions, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">s_rebuild</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">t_rebuild</span></code> where t reads from what s writes</p></li>
<li><p>a requirement that rebuilds not use damaged data, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">t_rebuild</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">s_leave</span></code>, where s is damaged and t reads from s.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then we have soft constraints for each variable weighted with the cost of using that option.</p>
<p>To generate these constraints, Cot walks through the build graph and maintains a multi-valued state. So it would look like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Key</span> <span class="pre">i</span> <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> <span class="pre">[Value</span> <span class="pre">1</span> <span class="pre">S_1,</span> <span class="pre">Value</span> <span class="pre">1</span> <span class="pre">S_2,</span> <span class="pre">Value</span> <span class="pre">2</span> <span class="pre">S_3,</span> <span class="pre">Damaged</span> <span class="pre">S_leave]</span></code>. Then for each thunk (visited in normal traversal order) Cot generates the constraints for each possibility. Then Cot updates the possible values for the keys it writes.</p>
<p>To deal with these constraints we need a MaxSAT solver - we can write a custom one or interface with an existing one. Using an off-the-shelf solver might save some effort, but there is significant overhead in serializing the constraints to an external solver, and this overhead can be avoided by using a native solver. The native solver will probably be naive and not have the finely tuned optimizations or heuristics of the off-the-shelf solvers, but most package version problems are very simple to solve. It’ll be easier to build the project with a native solver because all of the code will be in the same language (Haskell or Stroscot). In Cox’s list of package managers (at the end of <a class="bibtex reference internal" href="zzreferences.html#coxversionsat2016" id="id4">[Cox16]</a>), the split is 9-5 in favor of a native solver (although 3 of the native-solver package managers allow using an external solver with an option, so more like 9-8). Overall it seems writing a native solver is the best course of action. But we don’t have to start from scratch as there is a Haskell MaxSAT solver in toysolver on Hackage.</p>
<div class="section" id="wanted-files">
<h3>Wanted files<a class="headerlink" href="#wanted-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When using Cot as a package manager rather than a build system, we have lots of produced files that aren’t used by anything. Since Cot doesn’t see any users of the files it’ll leave them as damaged (unmaterialized) and not download them. So at the end of the build process we’d run special thunks that simply read in a bunch of files, to ensure that the files are up-to-date and available for use. These thunks are always out of date, which can be though of as having a special wanted key that always compares unequal. In the end these special thunks are actually the packages.</p>
<p>We could also add functionality to force re-executing specific damaged thunks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="restarting">
<h3>Restarting<a class="headerlink" href="#restarting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The constraint model is only an approximation of the truth, in particular it doesn’t cover a newly-executed thunk that adds a dependency on damaged data. The restarting strategy restarts build execution from the damaged thunk on detection of a read, which allows the build to continue if there is an unexpected dependency on damaged data. It requires traversal of the build graph to reconstruct the keystate at the point of re-execution, and all the work done after the point of re-execution is thrown away, so its efficiency isn’t optimal. In particular it is possible to re-execute a unit several times, in the case where we execute a unit B, then go back and re-execute a unit A due to damage, then have to execute B another time due to A changing C changing input to B.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="graph-pruning">
<h2>Graph pruning<a class="headerlink" href="#graph-pruning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Pruning the build graph as pioneered by Tup can result in a big speedup, only having to load/inspect the part of the build graph that’s necessary. But it requires some auxiliary data structures and careful record-keeping in order to look up the pieces efficiently.</p>
<p>We start with a change list, i.e. things that might have changed since our last build. The prototypical example is a list of changed files from a file-watching daemon. The alternative is scanning all the files for changes on startup. This can take several minutes with a hashing algorithm or a few seconds with modtimes.</p>
<p>First we process the change list into a list of possibly-changed keys. There are many various options (digest, modtime, etc.), so we need a hash table that maps key writes to all the thunks with key reads, really a filename-&gt;(set of thunk) table.</p>
<p>So in our build example, we would go from “main.c” to “cc main”. Next we want load the other thunks “run main”, “run prog”, “ld”. The first two are the ancestors of the thunk; we have to load the parent to see its synchronization operation and thus the order of execution. But we don’t have to load any children of the parents.  So we just need a thunk-&gt;(thunk parents) map to find all the parents.</p>
<p>We also have to load “ld”; this is done by looking up the writes of “cc main” in the filename-&gt;thunk table. We need to load thunks that read from the writes during execution, in case they are different from the recorded writes.</p>
<p>Note that we’ll always load the initial thunk, because we load the chain of parents. So after everything is loaded, execution can start from the initial thunk as normal, no need for a topological sort like in Tup. The difference is that we may have unloaded thunks as children; we do not want to execute these. But to keep the keystate consistent we need to be able to modify the keystate as though they were executed. In particular for each thunk we need the list of all the writes performed by the thunk and its children. But the thunk itself already stores the writes in its ThunkRecord; so computing the total writes is a matter of combination, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Total</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">Thunk</span> <span class="pre">//</span> <span class="pre">Union(Children)</span></code>, where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">//</span></code> is record update from Nix. These write lists can be precomputed during the initial run. Storing them efficiently with fast access is a little tricky since there is a lot of copying in the lists. For now I’ll store the full write list for each thunk, compressed, but there is probably a persistent data structure (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree">tree</a>?) that can efficiently re-use the data from other thunks while maintaining performance. At the other extreme we can just regenerate all the write lists by walking the thunk records, so these write lists can be cached and expired using LRU or something.
We also need to store the list of acquire/release lock operations, but most programs don’t use locks so this will be small.</p>
<p>The write lists can also be used as an incomplete check for data races; if after executing a thunk A, A has read a key from the global/shared keystate with a value different from the local keystate passed into the thunk (state passed into the parent thunk P // modifications of P // modifications synced in from synchronization operation of P), then a thunk not in the execution history of A must have modified the key - since this execution could have been delayed by the scheduler, it is a read-write data race. Similarly in the union of the children, if there are differing values among the children then there is a write-write data race.</p>
<p>Anyway, the recorded state also records if the key is damaged and the thunk that regenerates it. So we can use this during our damage simulation to load in damaged thunks when referenced and re-run them if necessary.</p>

<div class="section" id="pipeline">
<h2>Pipeline<a class="headerlink" href="#pipeline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We could think of an option to allowing a “what-if” query, “what would the output be if the task that made the output generated this”. But the semantics is murky - to preserve the modification, we must disable all of the tasks that would modify the generated file, which if they write other files means that the build will contain out-of-date files.</p>

<div class="section" id="cleaning">
<h2>Cleaning<a class="headerlink" href="#cleaning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When we re-execute a thunk, it is a good idea to restore the state of the outputs of the thunk to their original state (typically deleting them). Also at the end of the run we should garbage collect any unused thunks from the old run by deleting their outputs. Also in (hopefully rare) cases we want to delete all the outputs regardless of status.</p>

<li><p>Before running a task, we clean up old build results, if any, i.e. delete all provided keys (outputs) that are still present. After running a task we store its (keyed) outputs with either verifying or constructive traces.</p></li>
<li><p>To prune the store (which is a bad idea if there are multiple configurations that build different subsets), we can do as above and also load all the subtasks of present tasks. Then anything not loaded is not needed and its files etc. can be deleted.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="trace-journal">
<h2>Trace journal<a class="headerlink" href="#trace-journal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A robust build system design fundamentally depends on keeping a database of build traces. In particular to rebuild a command like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cat</span> <span class="pre">src/*</span></code> we must store the file list so as to detect deleted/added files. We could store this in a file, but an append-only journal is crash-tolerant and less HD-intensive. Since file paths have lots of redundant components, some lightweight streaming compression like lz4 is appropriate.</p>
<p>We record all of the process/thread semantics, with fork, locks, wait/signal, etc. as well as its I/O. The tasks’s version number / digest of its source code is also relevant. Reading the journal back, we end up with a list of interleaved thread traces.</p>
<p>Requesting execution of other tasks can be done sequentially or in parallel.</p>
<p>There are 3 main operations that show up in a task’s trace:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>writing a key</p></li>
<li><p>reading a key</p></li>
<li><p>requesting execution of other tasks</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To correctly build software, we assume that the task is deterministic besides the operations recorded in its trace - so the task can be skipped if all of its inputs and generated files are the same.</p>
<div class="section" id="in-memory">
<h3>In-memory<a class="headerlink" href="#in-memory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In-memory keys are the simplest to handle, because they’re small and we can simply store the whole value, and also because we don’t have to worry about external modification. We record a write in our journal as “write key xyz = …” and a read as “read key xyz = …”. Then the trace is invalid if we read something different from what was written, or if the key was never written.</p>
<p>If the key contents are large, we can intern it - journal an association “#5 = x”, then writes as “write key xyz is interned to #5 = …”, and reads as “read key xyz from intern #5”. We can’t use the key itself as #n because there might be multiple writes to the key.</p>
<p>The simplest example of an in-memory key is the command line arguments; we can store the full initial command line, and then have a thunk that parses the command line and writes various option keys. Another example is versioning keys. The initial thunk writes a key for each thunk with the compiled-in version, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">write</span> <span class="pre">(Version</span> <span class="pre">abc)</span> <span class="pre">v2.3</span></code>. Then each thunk reads its version and this read is stored in the thunk record, causing rebuilds when the version is changed.</p>

<div class="section" id="files">
<h3>Files<a class="headerlink" href="#files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Files are a little trickier because storing the whole contents of the file in the journal is infeasible. Instead we journal a proxy of the contents, stored in-memory. So writes look like “write file f with proxy p” and reads are “read file f with proxy p”. We assume that there aren’t any untracked writes during the build so the reads can be recorded using the in-memory value of p calculated from the writes.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>trivial proxy</dt><dd><p>Sometimes we want to ignore the file contents and always/never do an action. In such a case we can use a trivial proxy. There are two types, “always rebuild” and “never rebuild”. In the never case, the rebuild can still be triggered by a different file.</p>

<dt>dirty bit</dt><dd><p>The idea of a dirty bit is to have one piece of information per key, saying whether the key is dirty or clean. In the initial state all keys are clean.

<dt>version number</dt><dd><p>For toolchains in small projects, the version number from running <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gcc</span> <span class="pre">-V</span></code> etc. is often sufficient.

<dt>modtime/device/inode number</dt><dd><p>As opposed to make’s simple “is-newer” comparison, storing the full mtime value is pretty accurate. mtime changes at least as often as the content hash changes.

The device/inode number detects replaced files, e.g. if you <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mv</span></code> a file onto another one. The real disadvantage is over-rebuilding, due to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">touch</span></code> and similar. ctime and atime update even more frequently than mtime, so they don’t help. btime / creation time might be useful, in a manner similar to inode number. Simply checking all the modtimes sequentially is very efficient due to filesystem caching and it can be made even more efficient with various tricks (parallel threads, maybe grouping by directory).</p>

<dt>digest</dt><dd><p>A digest computed from the contents. There is a remote risk that the file will change without its digest changing due to a collision, but otherwise this detects changes accurately. The disadvantage of digests is that they are somewhat slow to compute, requiring a full scan of the file. But various virtual filesystems store precalculated file checksums, in which case those would be better to use than mtime. There are fast hash algorithms like <a class="reference external" href="https://cyan4973.github.io/xxHash/">xxHash</a> that have throughput faster than RAM, so the main bottleneck is the I/O. Looking at the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/wiki/Performance-comparison">benchmark</a>, and fruitlessly googling around to find other hashes not listed there (fnv1, murmurhash, siphash), it seems xxHash3 / xxHash128 are the fastest. But, if we are going to share the files over a network then one of the SHA’s or BLAKE3 might be better to prevent file-replacement attacks.

<h4>io_uring<a class="headerlink" href="#io-uring" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>It’s a little overkill, but the io_uring interface on Linux allows batching up calls asynchronously, which can speed up stat() and thus modtime reading by 20%. For hashing parallelism is likely counterproductive, as xxHash is I/O bound and parallelism turns sequential reads into random reads.</p>

<div class="section" id="access-tracing">
<h4>Access Tracing<a class="headerlink" href="#access-tracing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Specifying a lot of file read/write dependencies manually is tedious and error-prone, although writing a small script from scratch is not too difficult. So instead we want to use automatic tracing. There are various tracing methods:
* library preloading with fsatrace: fails on static linking, Go programs, and Mac system binaries
* ptrace with BigBro-fsatrace: Linux-only at present, might work on Windows/Mac eventually.
* chroot with FUSE: mount real system at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/real-system/</span></code>, FUSE system with all files <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/x</span></code> as symlinks to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/real-system/x</span></code>. The program shouldn’t access <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/real-system/</span></code> directly. Handles all programs, even forking/multiprocess programs like make, and gives build system the abilities to hide new files and generate files on-demand. Requires Linux + root.
* modtime checking: a little slow but useful if none of the other methods work. Doesn’t work multithreaded.</p>
<p>When we get back file paths from these tracers, they are usually absolute paths, or paths relative to the working directory. But we want standardized paths - if the build doesn’t need to be copied/moved, then e.g. the home directory path should be omitted. Rattle’s solution of named relative directories seems reasonable. Basically, if we have <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NAME=/x/y</span></code> and a path <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/x/y/z</span></code> then we shorten it to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$NAME/z</span></code>, similarly expanding the name, and we sort the list of names to do this efficiently (or maybe use a tree?).</p>
<p>If the list of files read/written is static and won’t ever change, another idea is to save space in the build journal by skipping writing the trace and instead writing a note that says “compute the trace using the static list”. But a lot of file dependencies are dynamic (e.g. header files), so it’s not clear how often this could be used. Also if the file list changes between build system versions then the database will be subtly corrupted.</p>

<div class="section" id="network">
<h3>Network<a class="headerlink" href="#network" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Often we wish to fetch data from over the network. There are a few common protocols:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>HTTP downloads: we can use wget, curl, aria2, or a custom library. The caching headers (Last-Modified &amp; ETag) are important for re-using old downloads.</p></li>
<li><p>FTP: this can be treated similarly to HTTP</p></li>
<li><p>Git, Bittorrent, IPFS: these are content-addressed stores so keeping track of the hash is sufficient</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A more complex example is deploying a container to AWS. The inputs are: all the configuration details for the host, the container image itself, and secret credential information. The output is a running instance or else a long log file / error message. But the running instance cannot be checksummed, so we must use some proxy criterion - the easiest is to redeploy if any inputs have changed, but we could also use a script to interrogate the running instance over the network.</p>
<p>If there are multiple containers that depend on each other, we have to encode the restarting behavior somehow. The easiest is probably to write a single script that takes all the configuration and starts up the containers in order, but this duplicates the build system task scheduling logic.</p>

<p>Remote Builds</p>
<p>Nix supports remote builds, where a local Nix installation can forward Nix builds to other machines. This allows multiple builds to be performed in parallel and allows Nix to perform multi-platform builds in a semi-transparent way. For instance, if you perform a build for a x86_64-darwin on an i686-linux machine, Nix can automatically forward the build to a x86_64-darwin machine, if available.</p>
<p>To forward a build to a remote machine, it’s required that the remote machine is accessible via SSH and that it has Nix installed. You can test whether connecting to the remote Nix instance works, e.g.</p>
<p>$ nix ping-store –store <a class="reference external" href="ssh://mac">ssh://mac</a></p>
<p>will try to connect to the machine named mac. It is possible to specify an SSH identity file as part of the remote store URI, e.g.</p>
<p>$ nix ping-store –store <a class="reference external" href="ssh://mac?ssh-key=/home/alice/my-key">ssh://mac?ssh-key=/home/alice/my-key</a></p>
<p>Since builds should be non-interactive, the key should not have a passphrase. Alternatively, you can load identities ahead of time into ssh-agent or gpg-agent.</p>
<p>If you get the error</p>
<p>bash: nix-store: command not found
error: cannot connect to ‘mac’</p>
<p>then you need to ensure that the PATH of non-interactive login shells contains Nix.
Warning: If you are building via the Nix daemon, it is the Nix daemon user account (that is, root) that should have SSH access to the remote machine. If you can’t or don’t want to configure root to be able to access to remote machine, you can use a private Nix store instead by passing e.g. –store ~/my-nix.</p>
<p>The list of remote machines can be specified on the command line or in the Nix configuration file. The former is convenient for testing. For example, the following command allows you to build a derivation for x86_64-darwin on a Linux machine:</p>
<div class="highlight-shell-session notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>uname
<span class="go">Linux</span>

<span class="gp">$ </span>nix build <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="go">  &#39;(with import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; { system = &quot;x86_64-darwin&quot;; }; runCommand &quot;foo&quot; {} &quot;uname &gt; $out&quot;)&#39; \</span>
<span class="go">  --builders &#39;ssh://mac x86_64-darwin&#39;</span>
<span class="go">[1/0/1 built, 0.0 MiB DL] building foo on ssh://mac</span>

<span class="gp">$ </span>cat ./result
<span class="go">Darwin</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It is possible to specify multiple builders separated by a semicolon or a newline, e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>–builders ‘<a class="reference external" href="ssh://mac">ssh://mac</a> x86_64-darwin ; <a class="reference external" href="ssh://beastie">ssh://beastie</a> x86_64-freebsd’</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Each machine specification consists of the following elements, separated by spaces. Only the first element is required. To leave a field at its default, set it to -.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The URI of the remote store in the format <a class="reference external" href="ssh://[username&#64;]hostname">ssh://[username&#64;]hostname</a>, e.g. <a class="reference external" href="ssh://nix&#64;mac">ssh://nix&#64;mac</a> or <a class="reference external" href="ssh://mac">ssh://mac</a>. For backward compatibility, <a class="reference external" href="ssh://">ssh://</a> may be omitted. The hostname may be an alias defined in your ~/.ssh/config.</p>
<p>A comma-separated list of Nix platform type identifiers, such as x86_64-darwin. It is possible for a machine to support multiple platform types, e.g., i686-linux,x86_64-linux. If omitted, this defaults to the local platform type.</p>
<p>The SSH identity file to be used to log in to the remote machine. If omitted, SSH will use its regular identities.</p>
<p>The maximum number of builds that Nix will execute in parallel on the machine. Typically this should be equal to the number of CPU cores. For instance, the machine itchy in the example will execute up to 8 builds in parallel.</p>
<p>The “speed factor”, indicating the relative speed of the machine. If there are multiple machines of the right type, Nix will prefer the fastest, taking load into account.</p>
<p>A comma-separated list of supported features. If a derivation has the requiredSystemFeatures attribute, then Nix will only perform the derivation on a machine that has the specified features. For instance, the attribute</p>
<p>requiredSystemFeatures = [ “kvm” ];</p>
<p>will cause the build to be performed on a machine that has the kvm feature.</p>
<p>A comma-separated list of mandatory features. A machine will only be used to build a derivation if all of the machine’s mandatory features appear in the derivation’s requiredSystemFeatures attribute..</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For example, the machine specification</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="mailto:nix&#37;&#52;&#48;scratchy&#46;labs&#46;cs&#46;uu&#46;nl">nix<span>&#64;</span>scratchy<span>&#46;</span>labs<span>&#46;</span>cs<span>&#46;</span>uu<span>&#46;</span>nl</a>  i686-linux      /home/nix/.ssh/id_scratchy_auto        8 1 kvm
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:nix&#37;&#52;&#48;itchy&#46;labs&#46;cs&#46;uu&#46;nl">nix<span>&#64;</span>itchy<span>&#46;</span>labs<span>&#46;</span>cs<span>&#46;</span>uu<span>&#46;</span>nl</a>     i686-linux      /home/nix/.ssh/id_scratchy_auto        8 2
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:nix&#37;&#52;&#48;poochie&#46;labs&#46;cs&#46;uu&#46;nl">nix<span>&#64;</span>poochie<span>&#46;</span>labs<span>&#46;</span>cs<span>&#46;</span>uu<span>&#46;</span>nl</a>   i686-linux      /home/nix/.ssh/id_scratchy_auto        1 2 kvm benchmark</p>
<p>specifies several machines that can perform i686-linux builds. However, poochie will only do builds that have the attribute</p>
<p>requiredSystemFeatures = [ “benchmark” ];</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>requiredSystemFeatures = [ “benchmark” “kvm” ];</p>
<p>itchy cannot do builds that require kvm, but scratchy does support such builds. For regular builds, itchy will be preferred over scratchy because it has a higher speed factor.</p>
<p>Remote builders can also be configured in nix.conf, e.g.</p>
<p>builders = <a class="reference external" href="ssh://mac">ssh://mac</a> x86_64-darwin ; <a class="reference external" href="ssh://beastie">ssh://beastie</a> x86_64-freebsd</p>
<p>Finally, remote builders can be configured in a separate configuration file included in builders via the syntax &#64;file. For example,</p>
<p>builders = &#64;/etc/nix/machines</p>
<p>causes the list of machines in /etc/nix/machines to be included. (This is the default.)</p>
<p>builders-use-substitutes</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If set to true, Nix will instruct remote build machines to use their own binary substitutes if available. In practical terms, this means that remote hosts will fetch as many build dependencies as possible from their own substitutes (e.g, from cache.nixos.org), instead of waiting for this host to upload them all. This can drastically reduce build times if the network connection between this computer and the remote build host is slow. Defaults to false.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>To build only on remote builders and disable building on the local machine, you can use the option –max-jobs 0.</p>

<p>An issue is “time travel”, a thunk reading a file from the previous build that hasn’t yet been generated in this build. Technically, our notion of consistency is based on a “clean build”, with the filesystem initialized to source files and all generated files deleted. For true replication, when re-building a task T, we would have to delete all the build files generated by tasks depending on T, in case T accidentally read “from the future”. But this is more easily detected after-the-fact, particularly in the case of parallel builds.</p>
<p>Shake features a built in “lint” features to check the build system is well formed. To run use build –lint. You are likely to catch more lint violations if you first build clean. The lint features are listed in this document. There is a performance penalty for building with –lint, but it is typically small.
* Detects changing the current directory, typically with setCurrentDirectory. You should never change the current directory within the build system as multiple rules running at the same time share the current directory. You can still run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cmd_</span></code> calls in different directories using the Cwd argument.
* Changing outputs after building. Detects if any files have changed after Shake has built them. There are a couple of causes for seeing this error:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If there is a rule producing foo.o, but another rule also modifies foo.o.
If you are on a file system where files change modification time after a while. A standard example would be an NFS drive where the underlying network file system stores modification times to second-level resolution, but the in-memory cache keeps them precisely.
If you modify the build sources while running a build.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A consequence of this lint triggering would be that a subsequent build would do additional work, as it spots modifications.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>trackRead/trackWrite assert various invariants about what files can be written where. Mainly</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>You can only read a file that is either your dependency, or a transitive dependency.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you can ignore certain missing rules with –lint-ignore=PATTERN. In general all files passed to trackRead or trackWrite are expected to be relative to the current directory, so –lint-ignore patterns should match those relative paths.</p>
<p>Using fsatrace you can augment command line programs (called with cmd or command) to automatically track which files they read and write, which turn into trackRead and trackWrite calls. To enable this feature pass –lint-fsatrace=DIR passing the directories you want to lint. Passing –lint-fsatrace is equivalent to –lint-fsatrace=. - namely only lint the current directory.</p>
<p>This feature requires fsatrace to be on the $PATH, as documented on the homepage. If you are using Windows, you can download a binary release here.</p>

Defaults to &#64;1&#64;. Maximum number of rules to run in parallel, similar to &#64;make –jobs=/N/&#64;.
For many build systems, a number equal to or slightly less than the number of physical processors

return the number of threads used).</p>

<div><p>Specifies that no new recipes should be started if there are other recipes running and the load average is at least load (a floating-point number). With no argument, removes a previous load limit.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>GNU make knows how to execute several recipes at once. Normally, make will execute only one recipe at a time, waiting for it to finish before executing the next. However, the ‘-j’ or ‘–jobs’ option tells make to execute many recipes simultaneously. You can inhibit parallelism in a particular makefile with the .NOTPARALLEL pseudo-target (see Special Built-in Target Names).</p>
<p>On MS-DOS, the ‘-j’ option has no effect, since that system doesn’t support multi-processing.</p>
<p>If the ‘-j’ option is followed by an integer, this is the number of recipes to execute at once; this is called the number of job slots. If there is nothing looking like an integer after the ‘-j’ option, there is no limit on the number of job slots. The default number of job slots is one, which means serial execution (one thing at a time).</p>
<p>Handling recursive make invocations raises issues for parallel execution. For more information on this, see Communicating Options to a Sub-make.</p>
<p>If a recipe fails (is killed by a signal or exits with a nonzero status), and errors are not ignored for that recipe (see Errors in Recipes), the remaining recipe lines to remake the same target will not be run. If a recipe fails and the ‘-k’ or ‘–keep-going’ option was not given (see Summary of Options), make aborts execution. If make terminates for any reason (including a signal) with child processes running, it waits for them to finish before actually exiting.</p>
<p>When the system is heavily loaded, you will probably want to run fewer jobs than when it is lightly loaded. You can use the ‘-l’ option to tell make to limit the number of jobs to run at once, based on the load average. The ‘-l’ or ‘–max-load’ option is followed by a floating-point number. For example,</p>
<p>-l 2.5</p>
<p>will not let make start more than one job if the load average is above 2.5. The ‘-l’ option with no following number removes the load limit, if one was given with a previous ‘-l’ option.</p>
<p>More precisely, when make goes to start up a job, and it already has at least one job running, it checks the current load average; if it is not lower than the limit given with ‘-l’, make waits until the load average goes below that limit, or until all the other jobs finish.</p>
<p>By default, there is no load limit.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Ensure that the complete output from each recipe is printed in one uninterrupted sequence. This option is only useful when using the –jobs option to run multiple recipes simultaneously (see Parallel Execution) Without this option output will be displayed as it is generated by the recipes.</p>
<p>With no type or the type ‘target’, output from the entire recipe of each target is grouped together. With the type ‘line’, output from each line in the recipe is grouped together. With the type ‘recurse’, the output from an entire recursive make is grouped together. With the type ‘none’, no output synchronization is performed.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>When running several recipes in parallel the output from each recipe appears as soon as it is generated, with the result that messages from different recipes may be interspersed, sometimes even appearing on the same line. This can make reading the output very difficult.</p>
<p>To avoid this you can use the ‘–output-sync’ (‘-O’) option. This option instructs make to save the output from the commands it invokes and print it all once the commands are completed. Additionally, if there are multiple recursive make invocations running in parallel, they will communicate so that only one of them is generating output at a time.</p>
<p>If working directory printing is enabled (see The ‘–print-directory’ Option), the enter/leave messages are printed around each output grouping. If you prefer not to see these messages add the ‘–no-print-directory’ option to MAKEFLAGS.</p>
<p>There are four levels of granularity when synchronizing output, specified by giving an argument to the option (e.g., ‘-Oline’ or ‘–output-sync=recurse’).</p>
<p>none</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This is the default: all output is sent directly as it is generated and no synchronization is performed.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>line</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Output from each individual line of the recipe is grouped and printed as soon as that line is complete. If a recipe consists of multiple lines, they may be interspersed with lines from other recipes.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>target</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Output from the entire recipe for each target is grouped and printed once the target is complete. This is the default if the –output-sync or -O option is given with no argument.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>recurse</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Output from each recursive invocation of make is grouped and printed once the recursive invocation is complete.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Regardless of the mode chosen, the total build time will be the same. The only difference is in how the output appears.</p>
<p>The ‘target’ and ‘recurse’ modes both collect the output of the entire recipe of a target and display it uninterrupted when the recipe completes. The difference between them is in how recipes that contain recursive invocations of make are treated (see Recursive Use of make). For all recipes which have no recursive lines, the ‘target’ and ‘recurse’ modes behave identically.</p>
<p>If the ‘recurse’ mode is chosen, recipes that contain recursive make invocations are treated the same as other targets: the output from the recipe, including the output from the recursive make, is saved and printed after the entire recipe is complete. This ensures output from all the targets built by a given recursive make instance are grouped together, which may make the output easier to understand. However it also leads to long periods of time during the build where no output is seen, followed by large bursts of output. If you are not watching the build as it proceeds, but instead viewing a log of the build after the fact, this may be the best option for you.</p>
<p>If you are watching the output, the long gaps of quiet during the build can be frustrating. The ‘target’ output synchronization mode detects when make is going to be invoked recursively, using the standard methods, and it will not synchronize the output of those lines. The recursive make will perform the synchronization for its targets and the output from each will be displayed immediately when it completes. Be aware that output from recursive lines of the recipe are not synchronized (for example if the recursive line prints a message before running make, that message will not be synchronized).</p>
<p>The ‘line’ mode can be useful for front-ends that are watching the output of make to track when recipes are started and completed.</p>
<p>Some programs invoked by make may behave differently if they determine they’re writing output to a terminal versus a file (often described as “interactive” vs. “non-interactive” modes). For example, many programs that can display colorized output will not do so if they determine they are not writing to a terminal. If your makefile invokes a program like this then using the output synchronization options will cause the program to believe it’s running in “non-interactive” mode even though the output will ultimately go to the terminal.</p>

FileStdin FilePath – ^ Take the &#64;stdin&#64; from a file.
InheritStdin – ^ Cause the stdin from the parent to be inherited. Might also require NoProcessGroup on Linux. Ignored if you explicitly pass a stdin.</p>
<p>Two processes cannot both take input from the same device at the same time. To make sure that only one recipe tries to take input from the terminal at once, make will invalidate the standard input streams of all but one running recipe. If another recipe attempts to read from standard input it will usually incur a fatal error (a ‘Broken pipe’ signal).</p>
<p>It is unpredictable which recipe will have a valid standard input stream (which will come from the terminal, or wherever you redirect the standard input of make). The first recipe run will always get it first, and the first recipe started after that one finishes will get it next, and so on.</p>

<p>BinaryPipes – ^ Treat the &#64;stdin&#64;/&#64;stdout&#64;/&#64;stderr&#64; messages as binary. By default ‘String’ results use text encoding and ‘ByteString’ results use binary encoding.
CloseFileHandles – ^ Before starting the command in the child process, close all file handles except stdin, stdout, stderr in the child process. Uses &#64;close_fds&#64; from package process and comes with the same caveats, i.e. runtime is linear with the maximum number of open file handles (&#64;RLIMIT_NOFILE&#64;, see &#64;man 2 getrlimit&#64; on Linux).</p>

<h3>Forcing/avoiding recompilation<a class="headerlink" href="#forcing-avoiding-recompilation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>if your build system is broken then you can’t fix it with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">touch</span></code> utility. so a command <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--touch</span></code> that forces files to be invalid seems necessary, although it wouldn’t be needed normally.</p>
<p>‘-t’
‘–touch’</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Touch files - mark the build as up to date without actually running it, pretending that the build was done but no output files changed, in order to fool future invocations of make. make walks through the build graph and modifies each initial filesystem input recorded in a thunk record to match the state from the filesystem. The name of the modified thunk is also printed, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">touch</span> <span class="pre">$thunk</span></code>, unless ‘-s’ or .SILENT is used. Note that intermediate or output files are not recorded, so they will still appear as damaged if they are modified and touch is run.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes you may have changed a source file but you do not want to recompile all the files that depend on it. For example, suppose you add a macro or a declaration to a header file that many other files depend on. Being conservative, make assumes that any change in the header file requires recompilation of all dependent files, but you know that they do not need to be recompiled and you would rather not waste the time waiting for them to compile.</p>
<p>If you anticipate the problem before changing the header file, you can use the ‘-t’ flag. This flag tells make not to run the recipes in the rules, but rather to mark the target up to date by changing its last-modification date. You would follow this procedure:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Use the command ‘make’ to recompile the source files that really need recompilation, ensuring that the object files are up-to-date before you begin.
Make the changes in the header files.
Use the command ‘make -t’ to mark all the object files as up to date. The next time you run make, the changes in the header files will not cause any recompilation.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>If you have already changed the header file at a time when some files do need recompilation, it is too late to do this. Instead, you can use the ‘-o file’ flag, which marks a specified file as “old” (see Summary of Options). This means that the file itself will not be remade, and nothing else will be remade on its account. Follow this procedure:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Recompile the source files that need compilation for reasons independent of the particular header file, with ‘make -o headerfile’. If several header files are involved, use a separate ‘-o’ option for each header file.
Touch all the object files with ‘make -t’.</p>
</div></blockquote>

<p>The make tool has a number of features to force rebuilds or skip rebuilds, all fundamentally modelled on file modification times forming an order, which is quite a different model to Shake.</p>
<p>-B / –always-make considers all targets out-of-date and rebuilds everything. The Shake equivalent is –rebuild.
-o FILE / –old-file=FILE / –assume-old=FILE does not remake the file FILE even if it is older than its prerequisites. The Shake equivalent is –skip=FILE.
-t / –touch touches files (marks them up to date without really changing them) instead of building them. The closest equivalent in Shake is –skip, but that only applies to this run. A hypothetical RebuildNever flag would more accurately model this flag.
-W FILE / –what-if=FILE / –new-file=FILE / –assume-new=FILE pretends that the target file has just been modified. Shake doesn’t really have an equivalent, as –rebuild applies to the rules to rebuild, whereas in Make this applies to the things that depend on it. In addition, Make often uses this flag in conjunction with dry-run, which Shake doesn’t yet have.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Rebuild :: [(Rebuild, FilePattern)]</dt><dd><p>^ What to rebuild</p>

</dl>
<p>RebuildNormal is the default setting, rebuild a rule if its dependencies have changed.
RebuildNow forces a rule to rebuild even if its dependencies haven’t changed. If the rule changes, then that will in turn cause anything depending on that rule to rebuild too. Useful to undo the results of ‘RebuildNever’.
RebuildLater causes a rule not to rebuild this run even if its dependencies have changed. Note that in future runs, if the RebuildLater is not set, the rule may rebuild.
RebuildNever permanently marks a file as up-to-date. This assumption is unsafe, and may lead to incorrect build results in this run, and in future runs. Assume and record that these files are clean and do not require rebuilding, provided the file has been built before. Useful if you have modified a file in some inconsequential way, such as only the comments or whitespace, and wish to avoid a rebuild.</p>

<p>Normally make gives up immediately in this circumstance, returning a nonzero status. However, if the ‘-k’ or ‘–keep-going’ flag is specified, make continues to consider the other prerequisites of the pending targets, remaking them if necessary, before it gives up and returns nonzero status.</p>
<p>Normally, when an error happens in executing a shell command, make gives up immediately, returning a nonzero status. No further recipes are executed for any target. The error implies that the goal cannot be correctly remade, and make reports this as soon as it knows.</p>
<p>When you are compiling a program that you have just changed, this is not what you want. Instead, you would rather that make try compiling every file that can be tried, to show you as many compilation errors as possible.</p>
<p>On these occasions, you should use the ‘-k’ or ‘–keep-going’ flag. This tells make to continue to consider the other prerequisites of the pending targets, remaking them if necessary, before it gives up and returns nonzero status. For example, after an error in compiling one object file, ‘make -k’ will continue compiling other object files even though it already knows that linking them will be impossible. In addition to continuing after failed shell commands, ‘make -k’ will continue as much as possible after discovering that it does not know how to make a target or prerequisite file. This will always cause an error message, but without ‘-k’, it is a fatal error (see Summary of Options).</p>
<p>The usual behavior of make assumes that your purpose is to get the goals up to date; once make learns that this is impossible, it might as well report the failure immediately. The ‘-k’ flag says that the real purpose is to test as much as possible of the changes made in the program, perhaps to find several independent problems so that you can correct them all before the next attempt to compile. This is why Emacs’ M-x compile command passes the ‘-k’ flag by default.</p>

This is why Emacs’ compile command passes the ‘-k’ flag by default.</p>
<p>Usually when a recipe line fails, if it has changed the target file at all, the file is corrupted and cannot be used—or at least it is not completely updated. Yet the file’s time stamp says that it is now up to date, so the next time make runs, it will not try to update that file. The situation is just the same as when the shell is killed by a signal; see Interrupts. So generally the right thing to do is to delete the target file if the recipe fails after beginning to change the file. make will do this if .DELETE_ON_ERROR appears as a target. This is almost always what you want make to do, but it is not historical practice; so for compatibility, you must explicitly request it.</p>
