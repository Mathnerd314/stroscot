-- | Get a checksum of a list of files, suitable for using as `shakeVersion`.

withTempFileWithin :: FilePath -> (FilePath -> Action a) -> Action a

-- | Create a temporary directory inside the system temporary directory.
--   The directory will be deleted after the action completes. As an example:
--
-- @
-- 'withTempDir' $ \\mydir -> do
--    'putInfo' $ \"Temp directory is \" ++ mydir
--    'writeFile'' (mydir \</\> \"test.txt\") \"writing out a temp file\"

-- | A 'parallel' version of 'forM'.
forP :: [a] -> (a -> Action b) -> Action [b]
forP xs f = parallel $ map f xs

-- | Execute two operations in parallel, based on 'parallel'.
par :: Action a -> Action b -> Action (a,b)
par a b = (\[Left a, Right b] -> (a,b)) <$> parallel [Left <$> a, Right <$> b]


-- | Create a finite resource, given a name (for error messages) and a quantity of the resource that exists.
--   Shake will ensure that actions using the same finite resource do not execute in parallel.
--   As an example, only one set of calls to the Excel API can occur at one time, therefore
--   Excel is a finite resource of quantity 1. You can write:
--
-- @
-- 'Development.Shake.shake' 'Development.Shake.shakeOptions'{'Development.Shake.shakeThreads'=2} $ do
--    'Development.Shake.want' [\"a.xls\",\"b.xls\"]
--    excel <- 'Development.Shake.newResource' \"Excel\" 1
--    \"*.xls\" 'Development.Shake.%>' \\out ->
--        'Development.Shake.withResource' excel 1 $
--            'Development.Shake.cmd' \"excel\" out ...
-- @
--
--   Now the two calls to @excel@ will not happen in parallel.
--
--   As another example, calls to compilers are usually CPU bound but calls to linkers are usually
--   disk bound. Running 8 linkers will often cause an 8 CPU system to grid to a halt. We can limit
--   ourselves to 4 linkers with:
--
-- @
-- disk <- 'Development.Shake.newResource' \"Disk\" 4
-- 'Development.Shake.want' [show i 'Development.Shake.FilePath.<.>' \"exe\" | i <- [1..100]]
-- \"*.exe\" 'Development.Shake.%>' \\out ->
--     'Development.Shake.withResource' disk 1 $
--         'Development.Shake.cmd' \"ld -o\" [out] ...
-- \"*.o\" 'Development.Shake.%>' \\out ->
--     'Development.Shake.cmd' \"cl -o\" [out] ...
-- @
newResource :: String -> Int -> Rules Resource
newResource name mx = liftIO $ newResourceIO name mx


-- | Create a throttled resource, given a name (for error messages) and a number of resources (the 'Int') that can be
--   used per time period (the 'Double' in seconds). Shake will ensure that actions using the same throttled resource
--   do not exceed the limits. As an example, let us assume that making more than 1 request every 5 seconds to
--   Google results in our client being blacklisted, we can write:
--
-- @
-- google <- 'Development.Shake.newThrottle' \"Google\" 1 5
-- \"*.url\" 'Development.Shake.%>' \\out -> do
--     'Development.Shake.withResource' google 1 $
--         'Development.Shake.cmd' \"wget\" [\"https:\/\/google.com?q=\" ++ 'Development.Shake.FilePath.takeBaseName' out] \"-O\" [out]
-- @
--
--   Now we will wait at least 5 seconds after querying Google before performing another query. If Google change the rules to
--   allow 12 requests per minute we can instead use @'Development.Shake.newThrottle' \"Google\" 12 60@, which would allow
--   greater parallelisation, and avoid throttling entirely if only a small number of requests are necessary.
--
--   In the original example we never make a fresh request until 5 seconds after the previous request has /completed/. If we instead
--   want to throttle requests since the previous request /started/ we can write:
--
-- @
-- google <- 'Development.Shake.newThrottle' \"Google\" 1 5
-- \"*.url\" 'Development.Shake.%>' \\out -> do
--     'Development.Shake.withResource' google 1 $ pure ()
--     'Development.Shake.cmd' \"wget\" [\"https:\/\/google.com?q=\" ++ 'Development.Shake.FilePath.takeBaseName' out] \"-O\" [out]
-- @
--
--   However, the rule may not continue running immediately after 'Development.Shake.withResource' completes, so while
--   we will never exceed an average of 1 request every 5 seconds, we may end up running an unbounded number of
--   requests simultaneously. If this limitation causes a problem in practice it can be fixed.

-- | Run an action which uses part of several finite resources. Acquires the resources in a stable
--   order, to prevent deadlock. If all rules requiring more than one resource acquire those
--   resources with a single call to 'withResources', resources will not deadlock.
withResources :: [(Resource, Int)] -> Action a -> Action a
withResources res act
    | (r,i):_ <- filter ((< 0) . snd) res = error $ "You cannot acquire a negative quantity of " ++ show r ++ ", requested " ++ show i
    | otherwise = f $ groupSort res
    where
        f [] = act
        f ((r,xs):rs) = withResource r (sum xs) $ f rs


-- | Given an action on a key, produce a cached version that will execute the action at most once per key per run.
--   Using the cached result will still result include any dependencies that the action requires - e.g. if the action
--   does 'need' then those dependencies will be added to every rule that uses that cache.
--   Each call to 'newCache' creates a separate cache that is independent of all other calls to 'newCache'.
--
--   The operations will not be cached between runs and nothing will be persisted to the Shake database.
--   For an alternative that does persist the cache, see 'Development.Shake.addOracleCache'.
--
--   This function is useful when creating files that store intermediate values,
--   to avoid the overhead of repeatedly reading from disk, particularly if the file requires expensive parsing.
--   As an example:
--
-- @
-- digits \<- 'newCache' $ \\file -> do
--     src \<- readFile\' file
--     pure $ length $ filter isDigit src
-- \"*.digits\" 'Development.Shake.%>' \\x -> do
--     v1 \<- digits ('dropExtension' x)
--     v2 \<- digits ('dropExtension' x)
--     'Development.Shake.writeFile'' x $ show (v1,v2)
-- @
--
--   To create the result @MyFile.txt.digits@ the file @MyFile.txt@ will be read and counted, but only at most
--   once per execution.
